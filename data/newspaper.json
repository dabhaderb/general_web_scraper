                "text": "It\u2019s difficult to overstate just how much the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated airlines. In 2020, industry revenues totaled $328 billion, around 40 percent of the previous year\u2019s. In nominal terms, that\u2019s the same as in 2000. The sector is expected to be smaller for years to come; we project traffic won\u2019t return to 2019 levels before 2024. Financial woes aside, the pandemic\u2019s longer-term effects on aviation are emerging. Some of these are obvious: hygiene and safety standards will be more stringent, and digitalization will continue to transform the travel experience. Mobile apps will be used to store travelers\u2019 vaccine certificates and COVID-19 test results. Other effects, though, are more profound. Unlike the 2008 global financial crisis, which was purely economic and weakened spending power, COVID-19 has changed consumer behavior\u2014and the airline sector\u2014irrevocably. This article will explore five fundamental shifts in the aviation industry that have arisen from the pandemic. For each of these shifts, we also issue a call to action. By responding to these shifts decisively now, carriers should be able to look beyond the pandemic and adapt to the long-term realities of COVID-19. 1. Leisure trips will fuel the recovery Business travel will take longer to recover, and even then, we estimate it will only likely recover to around 80 percent of prepandemic levels by 2024. Remote work and other flexible working arrangements are likely to remain in some form postpandemic and people will take fewer corporate trips. In previous crises, leisure trips or visits to friends and relatives tended to rebound first, as was the case in the United Kingdom following 9/11 and the global financial crisis (Exhibit 1). Not only did business trips take four years to return to precrisis levels after the attacks on the World Trade Center but they also had not yet recovered to pre-financial-crisis levels when COVID-19 broke out in 2020. Therefore, we expect that as the pandemic subsides, the rise in leisure trips will outpace the recovery of business travel. 1 Some carriers are highly dependent on business travelers\u2014both those traveling in business class and those who book economy-class seats right before they need to travel. While leisure passengers fill up most of the seats on flights and help cover a portion of fixed costs, their overall financial contributions in net marginal terms are negligible, if not negative. Most of the profits earned on a long-haul flight are generated by a small group of high-yielding passengers, often traveling for business. But this pool of profit-generating passengers has shrunk because of the pandemic. Watch A McKinsey Live event on 'Returning to corporate travel: How do we get it right?' The call: Revisit flight economics Airlines should reevaluate the economics of their operations, especially long-haul flights. First, a smaller contribution from business traffic could necessitate a different pricing logic. For example, today most carriers price point-to-point nonstop flights at a premium. Travelers who value time over price\u2014mostly business travelers\u2014book these nonstop flights. Leisure travelers, even those traveling in premium classes, are more price sensitive and may choose an indirect routing. This large gap between nonstop pricing and connect pricing may need to narrow. Second, lower business traffic may require network changes. Airlines added many flights over the past few years between hubs and smaller cities, using small-size widebodies such as the Boeing 787. These flights work because of the high-yielding business demand. With business demand subdued, economics favor larger aircraft flying less frequently. Airlines may find that larger aircraft such as Airbus A350s or Boeing 777s\u2014which have lower unit costs\u2014become the base of the long-haul network. Third, airlines may also look at reconfiguring the layout of their cabins to address the increased share of leisure traffic. At the simplest level, lower business-class demand may warrant smaller business-class cabins. Taking this further, products may shift to better cater to premium-leisure passengers, such as growth of premium-economy cabins or development of business-class seats more suitable for traveling as couples or groups. 2. Staggering debt levels will lead to ticket price increases and a larger role for government in the sector Many airlines have had to borrow huge sums of money to stay afloat and cope with high daily cash burn rates. Tapping into state-provided aid, credit lines, and bond issuances, the industry collectively amassed more than $180 billion worth of debt in 2020, a figure equivalent to more than half of total annual revenues that year. And debt levels are still rising (Exhibit 2). Repaying these loans is made even harder by worsening credit ratings and higher financing costs. 2 These costs will need to be recouped. Therefore, we\u2019ll likely see ticket prices rise. By our estimates, this could amount to a rise in ticket prices of about 3 percent, assuming a ten-year repayment window for only the additional debt taken on. Furthermore, when demand for air travel returns, it will likely outpace supply initially. We see a glut of latent demand of people eager to travel. It will take time for airlines to restore capacity, and bottlenecks such as delays in bringing aircraft back to service and crew retraining could lead to a supply\u2013demand gap, resulting in higher short-term prices. In many cases, airline rescue efforts come in the form of government bailouts\u2014with strings attached. We\u2019re seeing a reemergence of, or increase in, the level of state ownership and influence. In Europe alone, TAP Air Portugal, Lufthansa Group, and Air Baltic all received state aid combined with an increase or reintroduction of government shareholdings. The call: Be a constructive collaborator As the state becomes a more active player\u2014whether as a creditor, a direct shareholder, or as part of the board\u2014airlines will find themselves having to deal more closely with the authorities. Instead of seeing this as a necessary restriction to access much-needed funds, airlines can treat it as an opportunity to shape how the sector evolves with a key stakeholder. Airlines can work with regulators to set standards across a gamut of issues. These could include committing to reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions in return for more labor flexibility; increasing the cash-on-hand requirements to make airlines more resilient against future shocks; more balanced value sharing between airlines and other sectors such as airports; or changes in the ownership caps to allow greater inflows of foreign capital, reducing the reliance on state capital further down the road. 3. We will see a greater disparity of performance among airlines in the future Some airlines have responded to the pandemic by restructuring for greater efficiency; others are merely muddling through. Occasionally, this is linked to state-aid programs, which may reduce the incentive for much-needed measures such as cost, organizational, and operational restructuring. Airlines that are not proactively transforming risk failing to set the business up for longer-term structural value creation. As such, we\u2019re seeing some airlines pull ahead. Before COVID-19, an airline boasted an ROIC well ahead of the overall industry\u2019s rate of 5.8 percent. Not only did its stronger position pre-COVID-19 enable it to navigate the crisis thus far without taking on government loans of the scale relative to other airlines, it also made it possible for it to restructure to emerge with an even more competitive cost base. Another group of carriers that have an opportunity to transform their business are airlines that have access to a restructuring process, such as Chapter 11 in the United States. These carriers can renegotiate midlife leases, shed excess debt, and emerge leaner. They will be fierce competitors going forward. The call: Aim higher when it comes to IT and digital investment Becoming better can necessitate investment. Even though many airlines find themselves in financial straits, we recommend investing more in IT and digitalization, not less. Before the pandemic, airlines spent roughly 5 percent of their revenue on IT. This is relatively low compared with other sectors. By means of comparison, the retail industry spends around 6 percent on average, and financial services 10 percent. Airlines could consider stepping up IT and automation investment now. For example, airlines can respond to the quicker recovery of domestic and short-haul flights by investing in direct sales and owning the customer relationship. Relationships with IT and distribution providers could be reexplored. Carriers can also invest in the customer experience\u2014such as making check-in and boarding processes more seamless\u2014and support services\u2014from revenue accounting to invoicing\u2014to drive the next level of efficiency. Beyond this, the next horizon is analytics, which involves, among other efforts, using data in smarter ways to enhance decision making, requiring some investment but yielding significant payoffs. 4. Aircraft markets may be oversupplied for some time to come In the years before COVID-19, aircraft OEMs ramped up production in the anticipation of continued growth. This has led to a glut in aircraft availability. Furthermore, some carriers have returned relatively new aircraft to lessors, such as Norwegian Air Shuttle when it exited the long-haul market. Prices for used-aircraft leases have plummeted and are likely to remain lower. For instance, the monthly lease rate of a 2016 vintage Boeing 777-300ER aircraft was around $1.2 million in 2019. In 2020, the rate fell to less than $800,000. New aircraft are rumored to be available at even deeper discounts. The call: Act countercyclically now, if you can If finances permit, carriers can consider acting countercyclically: locking in orders for new aircraft or confirming operating leases now when demand is low. Aircraft are a significant expense for an airline, making up 10 to 15 percent of a carrier\u2019s cost base. As lease rates and OEM pricing fluctuate with supply and demand levels, inking deals during a crisis could allow carriers to enjoy a cost advantage for years to come. 5. Air freight will see undersupply for some time Over the past ten years, low cargo rates and the unprofitability of the cargo business have led many airlines to relinquish or scale back their dedicated cargo freighter fleets. However, cargo has been a lifeline for the aviation industry during COVID-19. Before the pandemic, cargo typically made up around 12 percent of the sector\u2019s total revenue; that percentage tripled last year. Based on data from the Airline Analyst, only 21 (down from 77 in 2019) of the airlines around the world that disclosed their operating performance achieved positive operating profits for the third quarter of 2020, traditionally the industry\u2019s most profitable quarter. Among these 21 airlines, cargo revenue accounted for 49 percent of total revenues on average. During the pandemic, e-commerce sales soared while many passenger flights\u2014which are responsible for delivering around half of total air cargo\u2014were grounded. As a result, cargo yields increased by about 30 percent last year. As commercial flights gradually return, belly supply will increase, although not to pre-COVID-19 levels for at least a few years, as the industry is expected stay smaller than before the pandemic for several years. The call: Bring back freighters, carefully In response to the high demand and low supply of air freight right now, carriers could investigate short- to medium-term opportunities to boost their cargo services. Airlines can enhance their flexibility through measures such as increasing the deployment of so-called preighters, or passenger airplanes that are used to transport cargo. Airlines may look at freighter conversions, especially as their passenger fleets reduce in number. Airlines need to be agile. Rushing headlong into developing and maintaining a large freighter fleet again comes with risk. Airlines need to grow cargo in an agile way that allows for quick adjustments; pursuing such a play should be seen as part of a wider theme of establishing a more flexible production setup. High fixed costs combined with unpredictable demand levels outside an airline\u2019s control increase the need for airlines to be able to scale down supply nimbly. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. There is some relief to be found in various parts of the world now that vaccinations have begun, but the road to recovery for air traffic will take several years. The shape of the post-COVID-19 airline sector is becoming clearer and holds lessons for airlines today. Multiple longer-running trends have been accelerated, such as digitization and the phasing out of less efficient aircraft. Burdened by debt, many carriers have depleted their cash reserves. But the forecast is not without bright spots. Travel will become greener and more efficient, and people are itching to travel again for holidays. Taking steps now will help airlines thrive in this transformed sector."

                "text": "Hotel Industry: Everything You Need to Know About Hotels! The hotel industry is one of the most important components of the wider service industry, catering to customers who require overnight accommodation. It is closely associated with the travel and hospitality industries, although there are notable differences in scope. In this article, you will learn more about the hotel industry, its links to those other service industry sectors, and the range of hotel and guest accommodation types. Quick menu: Extra: The Impact of Corona Virus Epidemic on the Hotel Industry What is a Hotel? Broadly speaking, a hotel is a managed building or establishment which provides guests with a place to stay overnight \u2013 on a short-term basis \u2013 in exchange for money. The precise features and services provided to guests can vary quite drastically from one hotel to another. Hotel owners aim to attract a particular type of customer through their pricing model and marketing strategy or via the range of services they offer. What is The Hotel Industry? Next, it is important to answer the question: what is the hotel industry? Put simply, the hotel industry is the section of the service industry that deals with guest accommodation or lodgings. By most definitions, the hotel industry refers to hotels and many other forms of overnight accommodation, including hostels, motels, inns, and guest houses. However, it does not usually include long-term or permanent forms of accommodation. Due to the nature of hotel services, it is closely associated with the travel and tourism industry. The Difference Between the Hotel Industry and the Hospitality Industry One common area of confusion concerns the difference between the hotel and the hospitality industry, with many people mistakenly believing the two terms refer to the same thing. However, while there is a cross-over, the difference is that the hospitality industry is broader in scope and includes multiple different sectors. The hotel industry is solely concerned with providing guest accommodation and related services. By contrast, the hospitality industry is concerned with leisure in a more general sense. As a result, it covers accommodation, restaurants, bars, caf\u00e9s, nightlife, and many travel and tourism services. Different Types of Accommodation in the Hotel Industry It is important to understand that the hotel industry is a catch-all term to describe guest accommodation services. With that in mind, it is worth noting that a variety of different accommodation types fall under this umbrella term. Some of the main types are described in more detail below: Hotels The most common type of accommodation in the hotel industry, a hotel is defined as an establishment that offers overnight accommodation, meals and other services. They are mainly aimed at travelers or tourists, although locals may also use them. Hotels provide private rooms and almost always have en-suite bathrooms. Bed and Breakfasts Bed and breakfasts, or B&Bs, are smaller establishments offering guests private rooms for overnight stays and breakfast in the morning. Often, these establishments are converted from private homes, and many B&B owners live on their property. While they are often a budget option, high-end or luxury B&Bs exist. Motels Motels are a form of overnight accommodation tailored towards motorists. For this reason, they are typically located conveniently by the roadside and offer ample free parking. A motel will generally have a number of guest rooms and may have some additional facilities but will usually have fewer amenities than hotels. Botels \u2018Botel\u2019 is the name given to a boat that has been adapted to offer hotel-style lodgings. Many botels are permanently moored riverboats, although others are converted ships, which can travel with guests onboard. They are especially popular in European cities with rivers or canals. Inns An inn is an establishment that provides temporary accommodation, usually along with food and drinks. Inns are smaller than hotels and are closer in size to bed and breakfasts, although inns are often slightly larger. Guests are allocated private rooms; food options usually include breakfast and dinner. Resorts Resorts are commercial establishments, usually consisting of a hotel and a variety of on-site services and amenities. Guests will usually have access to lodgings, restaurants, bars, entertainment options, recreational activities, and shops, which can all be accessed without leaving the premises. Serviced Apartments Popular among business travelers, serviced apartments are apartment-style lodgings, where guests benefit from a full range of services, such as room service, housekeeping and laundry services. Most serviced apartments also offer additional amenities, while the apartments tend to be larger than most hotel rooms. Hostals Often confused with hostels, a hostal is a form of accommodation primarily found in Spanish-speaking regions. They resemble a budget hotel, offering either private bedrooms or apartments, while they may also have a bar, restaurant and/or caf\u00e9. Most hostals are family-owned, and guests may sometimes share bathrooms with others. Hostels A hostel is a form of accommodation, typically aimed at those on a budget, where multiple guests sleep in different beds in the same living space. Effectively, guests pay for a bed, rather than a private room, and hostels hold a particular appeal for those looking to meet new people. Guests will usually share kitchen and bathroom facilities. Apartment Hotels An apartment hotel is essentially an apartment building that operates hotel-style services. It provides a similar experience to renting an apartment, albeit with the option to check-in and check out on-demand rather than signing a fixed-term contract. These hotels will generally also provide basic housekeeping services. Boutique Hotels Often promoted based on aspiration and luxury, boutique hotels are hotels situated within relatively small buildings. In most instances, they provide guests with upmarket rooms and high-quality services. They often have a particular theme and are commonly found in trendy urban areas. Condo Hotels A condo hotel is a condominium building that operates as a hotel, allowing guests to rent a condominium unit for a short period. They are almost exclusively found in cities, are especially popular in the United States, and combine the holiday home experience with hotel-style service features. Eco Hotels The basic definition of an eco-hotel is a hotel, which has taken steps to embrace sustainable living practices to minimize the environmental damage they are responsible for. They may prioritize the use of local products, adopt recycling measures, focus on energy saving, and use sustainable bed linen and towels. Guest Houses Typically, a guest house is a private house, which has been converted to provide guest lodgings. It is common for the guest area to be kept completely separate from another area, where the owner may live. Some guesthouses provide additional services, but many are operated on a self-service basis. Holiday Cottages A holiday cottage, also known as a holiday home, is simply a cottage or small house left to people temporarily for holiday purposes. Essentially, a guest pays to use the property for a short period of time. They are especially common in the UK, US, and Canada, and a key advantage is the freedom they offer guests. Pensions Pensions are a form of the guest house, similar to bed and breakfasts, while providing more meals throughout the day. In most cases, guests have an option of different plans, such as full board, where they get breakfast, lunch, and dinner, or half board, where they may get breakfast and dinner, without the lunch. Pop-Up Hotels A pop-up hotel is a name given to a hotel that is housed within a non-permanent structure. Typically, pop-up hotels exist for a short period of time only. They are most commonly associated with outdoor events, but pop-up hotels may also be established for a particular time of year, such as Christmas or the summer. Roadhouses Finally, roadhouses are relatively small establishments situated next to a road to attract passing customers. In some ways, they combine the features of a motel, B&B, and inn. They often offer several private guest rooms, similar to a B&B, and may also have a restaurant and/or a bar. Significance of Star Ratings in the Hotel Industry Within the hotel industry, star ratings are used to measure the quality of hotels. Although there is no international standard for defining what star ratings mean, the most popular version of this system is associated with the Forbes Travel Guide, where hotels are rated based on established criteria. Star ratings carry huge significance within the hotel industry because so many customers take the time to research hotels before making a booking. Although word of mouth and feedback from other customers is important, star ratings can carry extra weight because evaluators have experience with many different properties. The significance of hotel star ratings is further highlighted by the steps that those in the hotel industry take to achieve higher ratings, and this is for a good reason. Moving up a star rating can help hotels to generate more bookings and charge higher rates, while moving down can have the exact opposite effect. You can learn more about how star ratings work, how they can influence customers, and view a breakdown of what each star rating means by reading \u201cThe Hotel Star Rating System: Types, Benefits, Significance, Examples\u201d.

The Impact of Corona Virus Epidemic on the Hotel Industry The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has greatly impacted the hotel industry due to many countries being in full or partial lockdown. Governments worldwide have imposed travel restrictions, with closed borders and no domestic or international flights. Since the beginning of 2020, many local and international events have been postponed or canceled. These include the Olympic Games, UEFA EURO 2020, and the world\u2019s biggest travel expo, ITB Berlin, where over 150,000 visitors were expected to attend. With the restrictions on companies and millions of workers facing redundancies, it\u2019s not surprising to see many business events and trips canceled because of coronavirus fears. And because of the future uncertainties caused by the pandemic, people are reluctant to book their holidays for 2020 and even 2021. The hotel industry is one of the hardest-hit sectors to feel the impact of the pandemic. Some hotels have experienced up to 90 percent losses in bookings, while some have had to close down. Canceled reservations and lack of bookings have resulted in the loss of revenue for hotels. To add to this problem, most struggling hotels can\u2019t see a way out of their cash flow problems as the future is uncertain.

                "text": "1. What is GST in India? GST is known as the Goods and Services Tax. It is an indirect tax which has replaced many indirect taxes in India such as the excise duty, VAT, services tax, etc. The Goods and Service Tax Act was passed in the Parliament on 29th March 2017 and came into effect on 1st July 2017. In other words,Goods and Service Tax (GST) is levied on the supply of goods and services. Goods and Services Tax Law in India is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax that is levied on every value addition. GST is a single domestic indirect tax law for the entire country. Before the Goods and Services Tax could be introduced, the structure of indirect tax levy in India was as follows: Under the GST regime, the tax is levied at every point of sale. In the case of intra-state sales, Central GST and State GST are charged. All the inter-state sales are chargeable to the Integrated GST. Now, let us understand the definition of Goods and Service Tax, as mentioned above, in detail. Multi-stage An item goes through multiple change-of-hands along its supply chain: Starting from manufacture until the final sale to the consumer. Let us consider the following stages: Purchase of raw materials Production or manufacture Warehousing of finished goods Selling to wholesalers Sale of the product to the retailers Selling to the end consumers The Goods and Services Tax is levied on each of these stages making it a multi-stage tax. Value Addition A manufacturer who makes biscuits buys flour, sugar and other material. The value of the inputs increases when the sugar and flour are mixed and baked into biscuits. The manufacturer then sells these biscuits to the warehousing agent who packs large quantities of biscuits in cartons and labels it. This is another addition of value to the biscuits. After this, the warehousing agent sells it to the retailer. The retailer packages the biscuits in smaller quantities and invests in the marketing of the biscuits, thus increasing its value. GST is levied on these value additions, i.e. the monetary value added at each stage to achieve the final sale to the end customer. Destination-Based Consider goods manufactured in Maharashtra and sold to the final consumer in Karnataka. Since the Goods and Service Tax is levied at the point of consumption, the entire tax revenue will go to Karnataka and not Maharashtra. 2. The Journey of GST in India The GST journey began in the year 2000 when a committee was set up to draft law. It took 17 years from then for the Law to evolve. In 2017, the GST Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. On 1st July 2017, the GST Law came into force. 3. Objectives Of GST To achieve the ideology of \u2018One Nation, One Tax\u2019 GST has replaced multiple indirect taxes, which were existing under the previous tax regime. The advantage of having one single tax means every state follows the same rate for a particular product or service. Tax administration is easier with the Central Government deciding the rates and policies. Common laws can be introduced, such as e-way bills for goods transport and e-invoicing for transaction reporting. Tax compliance is also better as taxpayers are not bogged down with multiple return forms and deadlines. Overall, it\u2019s a unified system of indirect tax compliance. To subsume a majority of the indirect taxes in India India had several erstwhile indirect taxes such as service tax, Value Added Tax (VAT), Central Excise, etc., which used to be levied at multiple supply chain stages. Some taxes were governed by the states and some by the Centre. There was no unified and centralised tax on both goods and services. Hence, GST was introduced. Under GST, all the major indirect taxes were subsumed into one. It has greatly reduced the compliance burden on taxpayers and eased tax administration for the government. To eliminate the cascading effect of taxes One of the primary objectives of GST was to remove the cascading effect of taxes. Previously, due to different indirect tax laws, taxpayers could not set off the tax credits of one tax against the other. For example, the excise duties paid during manufacture could not be set off against the VAT payable during the sale. This led to a cascading effect of taxes. Under GST, the tax levy is only on the net value added at each stage of the supply chain. This has helped eliminate the cascading effect of taxes and contributed to the seamless flow of input tax credits across both goods and services. To curb tax evasion GST laws in India are far more stringent compared to any of the erstwhile indirect tax laws. Under GST, taxpayers can claim an input tax credit only on invoices uploaded by their respective suppliers. This way, the chances of claiming input tax credits on fake invoices are minimal. The introduction of e-invoicing has further reinforced this objective. Also, due to GST being a nationwide tax and having a centralised surveillance system, the clampdown on defaulters is quicker and far more efficient. Hence, GST has curbed tax evasion and minimised tax fraud from taking place to a large extent. To increase the taxpayer base GST has helped in widening the tax base in India. Previously, each of the tax laws had a different threshold limit for registration based on turnover. As GST is a consolidated tax levied on both goods and services both, it has increased tax-registered businesses. Besides, the stricter laws surrounding input tax credits have helped bring certain unorganised sectors under the tax net. For example, the construction industry in India. Online procedures for ease of doing business Previously, taxpayers faced a lot of hardships dealing with different tax authorities under each tax law. Besides, while return filing was online, most of the assessment and refund procedures took place offline. Now, GST procedures are carried out almost entirely online. Everything is done with a click of a button, from registration to return filing to refunds to e-way bill generation. It has contributed to the overall ease of doing business in India and simplified taxpayer compliance to a massive extent. The government also plans to introduce a centralised portal soon for all indirect tax compliance such as e-invoicing, e-way bills and GST return filing. An improved logistics and distribution system A single indirect tax system reduces the need for multiple documentation for the supply of goods. GST minimises transportation cycle times, improves supply chain and turnaround time, and leads to warehouse consolidation, among other benefits. With the e-way bill system under GST, the removal of interstate checkpoints is most beneficial to the sector in improving transit and destination efficiency. Ultimately, it helps in cutting down the high logistics and warehousing costs. To promote competitive pricing and increase consumption Introducing GST has also led to an increase in consumption and indirect tax revenues. Due to the cascading effect of taxes under the previous regime, the prices of goods in India were higher than in global markets. Even between states, the lower VAT rates in certain states led to an imbalance of purchases in these states. Having uniform GST rates have contributed to overall competitive pricing across India and on the global front. This has hence increased consumption and led to higher revenues, which has been another important objective achieved. 4. Advantages Of GST GST has mainly removed the cascading effect on the sale of goods and services. Removal of the cascading effect has impacted the cost of goods. Since the GST regime eliminates the tax on tax, the cost of goods decreases. Also, GST is mainly technologically driven. All the activities like registration, return filing, application for refund and response to notice needs to be done online on the GST portal, which accelerates the processes. 5. What are the components of GST? There are three taxes applicable under this system: CGST, SGST & IGST. CGST: It is the tax collected by the Central Government on an intra-state sale (e.g., a transaction happening within Maharashtra) It is the tax collected by the Central Government on an intra-state sale (e.g., a transaction happening within Maharashtra) SGST: It is the tax collected by the state government on an intra-state sale (e.g., a transaction happening within Maharashtra) It is the tax collected by the state government on an intra-state sale (e.g., a transaction happening within Maharashtra) IGST: It is a tax collected by the Central Government for an inter-state sale (e.g., Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu) In most cases, the tax structure under the new regime will be as follows: Transaction New Regime Old Regime Revenue Distribution Sale within the State CGST + SGST VAT + Central Excise/Service tax Revenue will be shared equally between the Centre and the State Sale to another State IGST Central Sales Tax + Excise/Service Tax There will only be one type of tax (central) in case of inter-state sales. The Centre will then share the IGST revenue based on the destination of goods. Illustration: Let us assume that a dealer in Gujarat had sold the goods to a dealer in Punjab worth Rs. 50,000. The tax rate is 18% comprising of only IGST. In such a case, the dealer has to charge IGST of Rs.9,000. This revenue will go to Central Government. The same dealer sells goods to a consumer in Gujarat worth Rs. 50,000. The GST rate on goods is 12%. This rate comprises CGST at 6% and SGST at 6%. The dealer has to collect Rs.6,000 as Goods and Service Tax, Rs.3,000 will go to the Central Government and Rs.3,000 will go to the Gujarat government since the sale is within the state. 6. Tax Laws before GST In the earlier indirect tax regime, there were many indirect taxes levied by both the state and the centre. States mainly collected taxes in the form of Value Added Tax (VAT). Every state had a different set of rules and regulations. Inter-state sale of goods was taxed by the centre. CST (Central State Tax) was applicable in case of inter-state sale of goods. The indirect taxes such as the entertainment tax, octroi and local tax were levied together by state and centre. These led to a lot of overlapping of taxes levied by both the state and the centre. For example, when goods were manufactured and sold, excise duty was charged by the centre. Over and above the excise duty, VAT was also charged by the state. It led to a tax on tax effect, also known as the cascading effect of taxes. The following is the list of indirect taxes in the pre-GST regime: Central Excise Duty Duties of Excise Additional Duties of Excise Additional Duties of Customs Special Additional Duty of Customs Cess State VAT Central Sales Tax Purchase Tax Luxury Tax Entertainment Tax Entry Tax Taxes on advertisements Taxes on lotteries, betting, and gambling CGST, SGST, and IGST have replaced all the above taxes. However, certain taxes such as the GST levied for the inter-state purchase at a concessional rate of 2% by the issue and utilisation of \u2018Form C\u2019 is still prevalent. It applies to certain non-GST goods such as: Petroleum crude; High-speed diesel Motor spirit (commonly known as petrol); Natural gas; Aviation turbine fuel; and Alcoholic liquor for human consumption. It applies to the following transactions only: Resale Use in manufacturing or processing Use in certain sectors such as the telecommunication network, mining, the generation or distribution of electricity or any other power sector 7. How Has GST Helped in Price Reduction? During the pre-GST regime, every purchaser, including the final consumer paid tax on tax. This condition of tax on tax is known as the cascading effect of taxes. GST has removed the cascading effect. Tax is calculated only on the value-addition at each stage of the transfer of ownership. Understand what the cascading effect is and how GST helps by watching this simple video: The indirect tax system under GST will integrate the country with a uniform tax rate. It will improve the collection of taxes as well as boost the development of the Indian economy by removing the indirect tax barriers between states. Illustration: Based on the above example of the biscuit manufacturer, let\u2019s take some actual figures to see what happens to the cost of goods and the taxes, by comparing the earlier GST regimes. Tax calculations in earlier regime: Action Cost (Rs) Tax rate at 10% (Rs) Invoice Total (Rs) Manufacturer 1,000 100 1,100 Warehouse adds a label and repacks at Rs.300 1,400 140 1,540 Retailer advertises at Rs. 500 2,040 204 2,244 Total 1,800 444 2,244 The tax liability was passed on at every stage of the transaction, and the final liability comes to a rest with the customer. This condition is known as the cascading effect of taxes, and the value of the item keeps increasing every time this happens. Tax calculations in current regime: Action Cost (Rs) Tax rate at 10% (Rs) Tax liability to be deposited (Rs) Invoice Total (Rs) Manufacturer 1,000 100 100 1,100 Warehouse adds label and repacks at Rs. 300 1,300 130 30 1,430 Retailer advertises at Rs. 500 1,800 180 50 1,980 Total 1,800 180 1,980 In the case of Goods and Services Tax, there is a way to claim the credit for tax paid in acquiring input. The individual who has already paid a tax can claim credit for this tax when he submits his GST returns. In the end, every time an individual is able to claims the input tax credit, the sale price is reduced and the cost price for the buyer is reduced because of lower tax liability. The final value of the biscuits is therefore reduced from Rs.2,244 to Rs.1,980, thus reducing the tax burden on the final customer. 8. What are the New Compliances Under GST? Apart from online filing of the GST returns, the GST regime has introduced several new systems along with it. e-Way Bills GST introduced a centralised system of waybills by the introduction of \u201cE-way bills\u201d. This system was launched on 1st April 2018 for inter-state movement of goods and on 15th April 2018 for intra-state movement of goods in a staggered manner. Under the e-way bill system, manufacturers, traders and transporters can generate e-way bills for the goods transported from the place of its origin to its destination on a common portal with ease. Tax authorities are also benefited as this system has reduced time at check -posts and helps reduce tax evasion. E-invoicing The e-invoicing system was made applicable from 1st October 2020 for businesses with an annual aggregate turnover of more than Rs.500 crore in any preceding financial years (from 2017-18). Further, from 1st January 2021, this system was extended to those with an annual aggregate turnover of more than Rs.100 crore. These businesses must obtain a unique invoice reference number for every business-to-business invoice by uploading on the GSTN\u2019s invoice registration portal. The portal verifies the correctness and genuineness of the invoice. Thereafter, it authorises using the digital signature along with a QR code. e-Invoicing allows interoperability of invoices and helps reduce data entry errors. It is designed to pass the invoice information directly from the IRP to the GST portal and the e-way bill portal. It will, therefore, eliminate the requirement for manual data entry while filing GSTR-1 and helps in the generation of e-way bills too.

                "text": "India's experience in rocketry began in ancient times when fireworks were first used in the country, a technology invented in neighbouring China, and which had an extensive two-way exchange of ideas and goods with India, connected by the Silk Road. Military use of rockets by Tipu Sultan during the Mysore War against the British inspired William Congreve to invent the Congreve rocket, predecessor of modern artillery rockets, in 1804. After India gained independence from British occupation in 1947, Indian scientists and politicians recognized the potential of rocket technology in both defence applications, and for research and development. Recognizing that a country as demographically large as India would require its own independent space capabilities, and recognising the early potential of satellites in the fields of remote sensing and communication, these visionaries set about establishing a space research organisation. Dr. Vikram Sarabhai was the founding father of the Indian space program, and is considered a scientific visionary by many, as well as a national hero. After the launch of Sputnik in 1957 he recognized the potential that satellites provided. India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who saw scientific development as an essential part of India's future, placed space research under the jurisdiction of the Department of Atomic Energy in 1961. The DAE director Homi Bhabha, who was father of India's atomic programme, then established the Indian National Committee for Sapce Research (INCOSPAR) with Dr. Sarabhai as Chairman in 1962. The Indian Rohini programme continued to launch sounding rockets of greater size and complexity, and the space programme was expanded and eventually given its own government department, separate from the Department of Atomic Energy. On August 15th 1969 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was created from the INCOSPAR programme under the DAE, continued under the Space Commission and finally the Department of Space, created in June of 1972. In the 1960s Sarabhai had taken part in an early study with NASA regarding the feasibility of using satellites for applications as wide as direct television broadcasting, and this study had found that it was the most economical way of transmitting such broadcasts. Having recognized the benefits that the satellites could bring to India from the very start, Sarabhai and the ISRO set about designing and creating an independent launch vehicle, capable of launching into orbit, and providing the valuable experience needed for the construction of larger launch vehicles in future. Recognizing the advanced capability India had in building solid motors with the Rohini series, and that other nations had favoured solid rockets for similar projects, the ISRO set about building the technology and infrastructure for the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV). Inspired by the American Scout rocket, the vehicle would be a four-stage all-solid vehicle. Aryabhata - India's first satellite Meanwhile, India began developing satellite technology anticipating the remote sensing and communication needs of the future. India concentrated more on practical missions, directly beneficial to people instead of manned space programs or robotic space explorations. The Aryabhata satellite, launched in 1975 from Kapustin Yar using a Soviet Cosmos-3M launch vehicle, was India's first satellite. SLV - India's first satellite launch vehicle By 1979 the SLV was ready to be launched from a newly-established second launch site, the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC). The first launch in 1979 was a failure, attributed to a control failure in the second stage. By 1980 this problem had been worked out. The first indigenous satellite launched by India was called Rohini-1. Following the success of the SLV, ISRO was keen to begin construction of a satellite launch vehicle that would be able to put truly useful satellites into polar orbits. Design of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) was soon underway. This vehicle would be designed as India's workhorse launch system, taking advantage of both old technology with large reliable solid-stages, and new liquid engines. At the same time, it was decided by the ISRO management that it would be prudent to develop a smaller rocket, based on the SLV, that would serve as a testbed for many of the new technologies that would be used on the PSLV. The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) would test technologies like strap-on boosters and new guidance systems, so that experience could be gained before the PSLV went into full production. Eventually, the ASLV was flight tested in 1987, but this launch was a failure. After minor corrections, another launch was attempted in 1988, this launch again failed, and this time a full investigation was launched into the cause, providing valuable experience, specifically because the ASLV's failure had been one of control - the vehicle could not be adequately controlled on removal of the stabilizing fins that were present on the SLV, so extra measures like improved maneuvering thrusters and flight control system upgrades were added. The ASLV development had also proven useful in the development of strap-on motor technology. It was not until 1992 that the first successful launch of the ASLV took place. At this point the launch vehicle, which could only put very small payloads into orbit, had achieved its objective. In 1993 the time had come for the maiden flight of the PSLV. The first launch was a failure. The first successful launch took place in 1994, and since then, the PSLV has become the workhorse launch vehicle - placing both remote sensing and communications satellites into orbit, creating the largest cluster in the world, and providing unique data to Indian industry and agriculture. Continual performance upgrades have increased the payload capacity of the rocket significantly since then. Under pressure, Glavkosmos halted the transfer of the associated manufacturing and design technology to India. Until then, ISRO had not been affected by technology transfer restrictions thanks to the political foresight of Sarabhai in indigenizing technology. However, elements of the ISRO management cancelled indigenous cryogenic projects in anticipation of the Russian deal. Instead of canceling the deal, Russia agreed to provide fully built engines instead, and India began developing an indigenous cryogenic engine to replace them, in the GSLV-II. There is still some controversy over the issue of the cryogenic engine acquisition, with many pointing to the decision to cancel indigenous projects as being a grave mistake - India would have likely had a fully indigenous engine operating by the time the GSLV launched if indigenous development had started from day one. Despite this one uncharacteristic slip in an otherwise extremely successful programme, and the loss of potential payload capacity over the decade that occurred as a result, ISRO pressed on. Currently the most powerful Indian launch vehicle in operation; the first development flight of the GSLV took place in 2001. The program\u2019s benefits have been scrutinized due to frequent payload cutbacks and delays. The indigenous cryogenic engine for the GSLV's upper stage was tested in 2007. ISRO has reconsidered the effectiveness of the GSLV for the needs of the 2000-2010 decade and began development of an indigenous and new heavy launch vehicle, GSLV III. The latter is not related to the GSLV-I/II and will be based around the proven format of liquid main stages and two solid strap-on boosters. It will resemble the Ariane 5 and other modern launchers and will have sufficient payload capacity for manned spaceflight. The inaugural flight is scheduled for 2008. Chandrayaan 2008: ISRO intends to send a small robotic spacecraft into lunar orbit mounted on a modified PSLV. It will survey the surface of the moon in greater detail than ever before and attempt to locate resources. Countries, including the US have expressed interest in attaching their own payloads to the mission. ISRO and NASA have an agreement to carry two NASA probes as a payload. AVATAR Scramjet: This is a long-term project to develop a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) restricted to the launch of satellites. Theoretically, AVATAR would be a cost effective launch vehicle for small satellites and therefore a commercially competitive launch system. A scaled-down technology demonstrator is scheduled to fly c.2008. Recently ISRO successfully tested a scramjet air breathing engine which produced Mach 6 for seven seconds. ISRO will continue research related to using scramjets in RLVs after 2010. ISRO has entered the lucrative market of launching payloads of other nations. Prominent among them are the launches of Israel Space Agency\u2019s, TecSAR spy satellite, and Israeli Tauvex-II satellite module. The CARTOSAT-2, launched on the July 2006, carried a small Indonesian payload of 56 kg. Leveraging its expertise in cryogenic technology to design Hydrogen fuel cells to store and handling of hydrogen; ISRO teamed up with Tata motors to develop a prototype hydrogen passenger car for Indian market, expected to hit road by end of 2008. On November 15, 2007 ISRO achieved a significant milestone through the successful test of indigenously developed Cryogenic Stage, to be employed as the upper stage of India's Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). The test was conducted for its full flight duration of 720 seconds on November 15, 2007 at Liquid Propulsion test facility at Mahendragiri, in Tamil Nadu. With this test, the indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage has been fully qualified on the ground. The flight stage is getting ready for use in the next mission of GSLV (GSLV-D3) in 2008. On April 28, 2008 ISRO successfully launched 10 satellites in a single mission further boosting it's capabilities in space. This includes 690 kg CARTOSTAT-2 and another 83 kg mini Indian satellite, IMS-1; and eight other nano satellites made by various universities; and research and development institutions in Canada and Germany offered at a subsidized price as part of a goodwill gesture by the Indian Department of Space."

                "text": "\" \" Apollo 13 flight directors applaud the successful splashdown of the Command Module \"Odyssey\" after the spacecraft suffered an explosion that shut down almost every system necessary to sustain life onboard. NASA Apollo 13 was headed for the moon. On April 11, 1970, the spacecraft lifted off. Fifty-five hours and 55 minutes later, an explosion shut down almost every system necessary to sustain life onboard. The string of events leading to the explosion began in 1965, with an oversight involving the oxygen tank thermostats. Tank No. 2 \u2014 which had been damaged before the launch \u2014 violently ruptured when a fan was turned on. That set the stage for one of the most amazing collaborative rescues in history. So many things went wrong on Apollo 13, it's an engineering miracle that the crew \u2014 astronauts James Lovell, John Swigert and Fred Hayes \u2014 made it home at all, let alone alive and well [source: Banke]. Advertisement Minutes after the crew completed a television broadcast from space, telling America everything was going well, an explosion shook the spacecraft. One disaster led to another. When Tank No. 2 blew up, the force caused another oxygen tank to malfunction. Immediately after, two of the craft's three fuel cells shut down. Apollo 13 was 200,000 miles (321,868 kilometers) away from home, venting oxygen into space, and its normal supply of electric power, water, oxygen, heat and light had been cut off. The ingenuity that followed is a testament to the genius of the human mind and spirit. To conserve whatever power, food, water and oxygen was left, the astronauts aboard Apollo 13 survived on almost no food, water and sleep and in temperatures that dropped to near freezing. The crew members lost a combined 31.5 pounds (14.3 kilograms) in less than six days. Meanwhile, the people on duty at NASA's Mission Control center from April 11 through April 17 found a way to get the men home. They did months of calculation in days. They found a way to get the lunar module to support the crew and get the spacecraft back to Earth, although it was never intended for that purpose. The canisters that removed carbon dioxide from the command module didn't fit the system in the lunar module. So Mission Control found a way for the astronauts to make them fit using tools they had onboard: cardboard, plastic bags and tape. Still, with no controls, no extended life support and no navigation system, the biggest problem of all was how to get the craft into a trajectory for an Earth landing. Apollo 13 had already made the planned adjustments for a moon landing before the initial explosion. Mission control developed a plan. The onboard navigation was based on finding a key star. That system was out. In three hours, NASA found a way to use the sun instead, a series of calculations that would normally take three months; and they found a way to use the moon's pull to get the craft into the right position, because they had to save all of the power for the trip home. The calculations based on the sun turned out to be accurate to within less than 1 degree. Apollo 13 rounded the moon and descended toward Earth. So much condensation had built up on the walls of the lunar module from the days of cold that when the spacecraft finally powered up -- and heated up -- for the trip home, it rained inside the cabin [source: NASA]. Apollo 13 landed successfully on April 17, 1970, in the Pacific Ocean. While all of the astronauts were fine, the spacecraft, of course, was not. But that was typical for the time. NASA didn't have a working reusable spacecraft until 1981, when the first space shuttle, named Columbia, made history."

                "text": "An important tradition linking sport and culture, the history of the Olympic Games dates back to over one thousand years. Although that history may be disjointed in places, the Games have well and truly made a comeback. Even the early festivals organised by the Ancient Greeks demonstrated the values that still form the core of the Olympic Spirit today. Moreover, in Antiquity, warring states observed a truce throughout the sporting competitions \u2013 a tradition that continues today, with the United Nations General Assembly adopting the Olympic Truce ahead of each edition of the Games. The history of the Games is incredibly rich and spans millennia. The first written evidence of the official Games dates from 776 BC, when the Greeks began measuring time in Olympiads, or the duration between each edition of the Olympic Games. The first Olympic Games were held every four years in honour of the god Zeus. From then on, a number of artistic activities such as music, singing, poetry and theatre were organised at the Pythian or Delphic Games (a separate event to the Games held in Olympia), linking culture and sport right from the beginning of the Games. In 393 AD, the Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned the Olympic Games for religious reasons, claiming that they encouraged paganism. They were not revived until the modern era A revival in Paris A number of initiatives to re-establish an international sporting event were attempted at the end of the 19th century, but failed due to the lack of coordination among the worldwide sporting movement \u2013 until one man decided to bring the main stakeholders together in Paris. The Olympic Games were therefore revived at the first Olympic Congress, organised by Baron Pierre de Coubertin and held at the Grand Amphitheatre at the Sorbonne University from 16 to 23 June 1894. Two thousand people attended, including 58 French delegates representing 24 sports organisations and clubs, and 20 delegates from Belgium, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the United States representing 13 foreign sports federations. As the congress came to an end on 23 June, the Olympic Games were reborn and the International Olympic Committee created. The principles that guided Baron Pierre de Coubertin in this endeavour and inspired Olympism and the Olympic movement include : Promoting the development of the physical and mental qualities that form the foundation of sport; Educating young people through sport in a spirit of mutual understanding and friendship with a view to help build a better, more peaceful world; Sharing the Olympic ideals with the whole world and creating an international sense of goodwill; and Bringing together athletes from all over the world for a major celebration of sport every four years, the Olympic Games. Women finally allowed to take part The first Olympic Games of the modern era took place in Athens, in the country where the original Games took place in Antiquity, in April 1896. Paris hosted the second Games in 1900. The Paris 1900 Olympic Games saw women compete for the first time. The first female Olympic champion was Charlotte Cooper, a British tennis player who won Wimbledon five times. Out of a total of 997 athletes, 22 were women, competing in just five sports: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian events and golf. Of these disciplines, only golf and tennis included women\u2011only events. According to the Olympic Charter, the IOC\u2019s role is \u201cto encourage and support the promotion of women in sport at all levels and in all structures, with a view to implementing the principle of equality of men and women\u201d. Female participation in the Olympic Games has increased dramatically since; 48.9% of the athletes at the 2020 Tokyo Games are expected to be women, as opposed to 23% at the 1984 Los Angeles Games and just 13% at the 1964 Tokyo Games. The IOC has been working with international federations as well as the Olympic Games Organising Committees to increase the number of women\u2019s events at the Games for over 20 years. By adding a women\u2019s boxing event, the Games in London in 2012 were the first where women competed in all sports of the Olympic programme. At the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016, 45% (5,059 women out of a total of 11,238) of the athletes were women. The Games of Tokyo in 2021 were the most equal yet, with 48.9% women athletes. The development of the Games over the centuries The 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis (Missouri) were the first to distribute gold, silver and bronze medals, and also included the first known disabled athlete to compete in the Olympic Games, George Eyser. He won six medals in gymnastics, three of which were gold. The Olympic Games in Stockholm in 1912 were the first to include competitors from all five continents represented by the Olympic rings. It was also the year that women made their debut in the swimming events. From 1912 to 1948, artistic competitions were part of the modern Olympic Games, on the initiative of Pierre de Coubertin. Medals were awarded for sport\u2011related artwork falling in five categories: architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture. In 1920, the Games continued after having been cancelled in 1916 due to World War I. The Olympic flag and the Olympic Oath, written by Pierre de Coubertin, were revealed at the Games in Antwerp. \u201cWe swear that we will take part in the Olympic Games in a spirit of chivalry, for the honour of our country and for the glory of sport.\u201d 1924 The Olympic Games were held for the second and third times in France \u2013 in Chamonix from January to February for the first ever Winter Olympic Games, then in Paris again in the summer. The Olympic motto of \u201ccitius, altius, fortius\u201d (faster, higher, stronger), used by Pierre de Coubertin since 1896 and taken from the priest Henri Didon, was also highlighted that year. The Paris Olympic Games of 1924 were the first to build an Olympic Village, which has become customary at every Games since. i The Colombes olympic Village, and services available for the athletes (official report of the VIIIth Olympiad). \u00d7 1932 During the Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York, a woman acted as the flag\u2011bearer for an Olympic delegation for the first time; that woman was Mollie Phillips, a figure skater for Great Britain. 1936 The Winter and Summer Olympic Games took place in Germany, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Berlin respectively. For the first time, the spectacle of the opening ceremony was broadcast live \u2014 an incredible development. Between big screens set up in Germany and the few households owning television sets, around 150,000 viewers tuned in. However, the Games served as a propaganda tool for Nazi Germany; the epitome of this was Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentary film of the Games in Berlin, Olympia, which served as a monument to Nazism. It was also at the Berlin Games in 1936 that the Olympic flame was introduced for the first time. 1940-1944 the Olympic Games of the XII and XIII Olympiads were cancelled due to the ongoing World War II. The Winter Olympic Games held at St Moritz in 1948 were therefore named \u201cThe Games of Renewal\u201d. 1952 The Winter Olympic Games in Oslo were declared open by a woman for the first time \u2013 Princess Ragnhild of Norway. 1960 The ninth Stoke Mandeville Games were held in the same city as the Olympic Games, Rome, one week later. This event is considered to be the first ever Paralympic Games. 1968 The Grenoble Olympic Games were broadcasted live and in colour on television for the first time. i General view of the Olympic Flame during the Opening Ceremony of the 1968 Winter Olympics \u00d7 1988 Since the Games in S\u00e9oul, the Olympic and Paralympic Games have always taken place in the same city, separated by just a few weeks. 1994 The Winter Games were held in Lillehammer , just two years after the last Winter Games in Albertville, in 1992. This adjustment was made so that the Winter Games would no longer be held in the same year as the Summer Olympics, which take place in the first year of each Olympiad. 1996 For the first time in Olympic history, all 197 of the National Olympic Committees (NOC) were represented at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Of those NOCs, 79 won medals, with 53 taking gold. That same year, Italian archer Paola Fantato became the first athlete to compete in the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the same year. 2000 At the Olympic Games in Sydney, North and South Korea marched together under the same flag at the opening ceremony. This was an unprecedented symbol of peace since diplomatic relations between the two states had ended after the Korean War of 1950 to 1953. 2003 The legacy concept was added to the document that sets out the rules for governing the Olympic movement, the Olympic Charter. This addition came about after a period of reflection in the 1990s, with the Games in Barcelona in 1992 serving as an example. The Olympic Games needed to be seen as more than just a periodic sport event, but also a way to bring about urban development and have a positive impact on the society where they take place. From now on, to be selected by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), applicant cities must have a long\u2011term plan. 2004 The Iraqi football team stunned at the Games in Athens. Despite the war ravaging their country, the team reached the semi\u2011finals of the tournament, offering a brief distraction for Iraqis and the entire world from their country\u2019s dramatic situation. That same year was the first time that the Olympic torch relay, after leaving Olympia, crossed every habitable continent before returning to Greece. 2010 The first summer version of the Youth Olympic Games took place in 2010, with the first winter version taking place in 2012 \u2014 proof of the Olympic movement\u2019s strong commitment to youth and education. i Opening ceremony of the 2012 Winter Youth Olympic Games in Innsbruck (Photo credit : IOC media). \u00d7 2014 The 127th Session of the IOC took place in Monaco on 8 December and approved to modify the Olympic Charter by adding: \u201cany form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement\u201d.

Formula One is an entrancing sport and it is quite easy to fall in love with it. As a beginner, you may feel a little bit like an outsider when other fans are discussing a driver, car, or race. That\u2019s nothing to worry about. In this article, we will give you enough knowledge to set you on your way to becoming an F1 fan. Formula One is the fastest motorsport in the world, let us help you to find your feet in the F1 world with equal speed. Here is our Beginners Guide to Formula 1 in 2023\u2026 Advertisement The Beginners Guide to Formula 1: Formula 1 Explained What is Formula One? Formula One (F1) is a series of races held at different venues around the world, of the fastest open-wheel, open-cabin, single-seated, four-wheeled autos in the world. There have been a few years when even six-wheeled cars participated in F1. The word \u2018Formula\u2019, included in the name, refers to a set of rules that the constructors of the car, its mechanics and the drivers have to strictly follow during the tenure that they are members of F1. When motor racing first began, there were no limitations on the power or the size of the cars. The races became unequal with cars with more power and bigger sizes easily outpacing the smaller cars. The races also created dangerous situations in which many participants got seriously hurt, some even fatally. When racing resumed after World War II, the governing body of the sport, the FIA, introduced a set of rules that set limits on the size and the power of the cars. This created an even playing field for the participants and drivers, while more stress was laid on the efficiency and design of the cars and also the capability of the drivers. The word \u2018One\u2019 comes from the grading FIA issues to the racing tracks, the approved cars and the drivers\u2019 licences. The \u2018One\u2019 is also to distinguish F1 from street car racing and also to indicate that it is the ultimate in formula racing. Formula One is governed by the Federation Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (FIA) owned by the Formula One Group. The FIA, established on 20 June 1904, is a non-profit organisation and represents the interest of motoring organisations and motor car users. The organisation amends, alters and introduces rules to Formula One so as to ensure the safety of the participants in the races, promote fair play, and ensure that the followers and spectators of Formula One get a good deal. Advertisement The History of Formula One Formula One originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix races. Though the \u2018formula\u2019 or a set of rules was agreed to by several Grand Prix organisations before World War II, races were suspended during the war. Formula One, a new set of rules, were agreed upon by the racing organisations in 1946. The first non-championship race was the Turin Grand Prix held the same year in Italy. The following year the World Drivers\u2019 Championship was formalised. Achille Varzi, an Italian driver, won the race in an Alfa Romeo. The first world championship race was held in 1950 at Silverstone in the United Kingdom. Guiseppe Farina, an Italian driver in his Alfa Romeo, was the first driver to win the World Drivers\u2019 Championship that year. Juan Manuel Fangio, an Argentinian driver and Farina\u2019s teammate, narrowly missed the championship title in 1950. But Fangio came back strongly to win 1951, \u201854, \u201855, \u201856 and \u201857 championship titles. His record of 5 championship titles was surpassed 45 years later when Michael Schumacher won his sixth World Driver\u2019s Championship in 2003. The Constructors Championship was introduced in 1958. Then called the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, the first cup in 1958 was won by Vanwall. According to FIA, the Constructors Championship, \u201cthe constructor of an engine or chassis is the person (including any corporate or unincorporated body) which owns the intellectual rights to such engine or chassis.\u201d That is the reason teams have had names such as McLaren-Renault in the past. It meant that while the chassis of the F1 car was built by McLaren, the engine was supplied by Renault. Both parties worked together to build a car suited to the tracks and their drivers. Over the years there have been only five countries that have shared the Constructors\u2019 Championship between them. The countries are the UK leading with 33 championships, Italy (16), Germany (8), Austria (4) and France (3). Ferrari of Italy with 16 championships is the top constructor to date. Formula One went through many changes in its rules. Most of the changes were aimed at minimising risk to the cars and drivers and increasing the spectator appeal of the sport. There were changes in engine sizes, car width and lengths, fuel tank sizes and the sizes of the tyres. Advertisement Formula 1 Cars Formula One is all about cars and every fan would like to know more about them. They are indeed a fascinating piece of machinery and a lot of effort goes into their construction. That is precisely why the Constructor\u2019s Championship is awarded at the end of every racing season. Cars have evolved drastically over almost seventy years of Formula One. Today\u2019s cars are much safer and more manoeuvrable. The aerodynamics have improved and electronics have crept in substantially over the years. Because of that, drivers have better control over the cars resulting in better speeds and fewer accidents. However, F1 cars still have open wheels and open cockpits and are single-seated. The body of a Formula 1 car is made from lightweight materials like carbon fiber, which helps to keep the car as light as possible. The cars are also designed to be as aerodynamic as possible, with sleek, low-slung bodies and complex aerodynamic features like wings and diffusers. Under the hood, Formula 1 cars are powered by highly advanced engines that can produce over 1,000 horsepower. These engines are hybrid V6 turbocharged units, and they are designed to be as efficient and powerful as possible. One of the most distinctive features of a Formula 1 car is the open cockpit, which allows the driver to be fully exposed to the elements and gives them a clear view of the track ahead. The driver sits in a low-slung seat that is designed to be as comfortable and supportive as possible, and they are surrounded by a roll cage for safety. Advertisement Formula 1 Car Design Formula One cars are aerodynamically designed to provide the least resistance as they cut through the air. The feature not only helps them attain great speeds but also to consume less fuel as well as to get a better grip on the tarmac. Because of their aerodynamic design Formula cars attain a speed greater than that of an airliner at take-off. But the wings and the diffusers of the car produce a negative lift or a downforce that presses the car down upon the track. Or else, drivers would have little control over the cars as cars would be airborne over the track because of the airlift. A Formula One car produces 5G of downforce on average. It means that five times the weight of the car is pressing down on the track. This gives the tyres traction and prevents the car from skidding on bends and sharp corners. The downforce also allows the drivers to take corners and bends at speeds much higher than we could in our road cars. Advertisement Formula 1 Engines Since 2014, all F1 cars have 1.6L, V6 turbocharged engines. To those uninitiated, the number after \u2018V\u2019 stands for the number of cylinders on the engine. The number before \u2018L\u2019 represents the displacement volume in litres of all the cylinders of the engine taken together. F1 cars are required to weigh a minimum of 746kgs without the driver and fuel in them. Constructors, along with the other members of the team including drivers, have to optimise the horsepower, torque and fuel efficiency to suit their requirements. That is why F1 cars\u2019 engines are fine-tuned for every F1 circuit. Revolutions per minute or revs as we call it, for F1 car engines are limited to 15000 rpm. F1 cars are capable of speeds of up to 375 (235 mph) kilometres per hour. Juan Pablo Montoya hit a top speed of 372.6 kph (231.523 mph) during the Italian Grand Prix in 2005 while driving a McLaren-Mercedes car. Advertisement Formula 1 Tyres Tyres play a big part in Formula One races. Pirelli is officially recognised as the tyre supplier by FIA for Formula One. Unlike street car tyres, Formula One car tyres are built to last only between 60 to 120 kilometres (40 to 80 miles). Because one set of tyres will not last the distance of any F1 race, drivers have to make pit stops to replace tyres so that they can complete the races. Formula One car tyres are rated from C1 to C5 with C1 the hardest tyres and C5 the softest. Until the conclusion of the 2021 season F1 used 13-inch tyres, however, from 2022 they moved to 18-inch tyres as part of a raft of new technical regulations designed to make the racing more even. Advertisement Formula 1 Teams Participants in Formula One are not individuals but teams. You may not realise it, but each Formula One team employs hundreds of technicians, engineers and support staff. If you include the designers and the assembly employees, that number could well exceed one thousand. There are ten teams enrolled for the 2023 Formula One season with two cars each. According to the rules for the season, a maximum of 26 cars will be allowed to compete. That would mean a maximum of 13 teams because each team is allowed to field two cars. A formula One team comprises all the entities that design and produce the car and own the intellectual rights. Therefore if the chassis is designed by one company and the engine is supplied by another, the two taken together become the participating team. That is the reason you will hear names like Benetton-Ford or Williams-Renault. Here is the list of F1 teams for 2023, along with their drivers: Mercedes with Lewis Hamilton and George Russell Red Bull Racing with Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez Ferrari with Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz McLaren with Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri Alpine F1 Team with Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly AlphaTauri with Yuki Tsunoda and Daniel Ricciardo Aston Martin with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll Williams with Alexander Albon and Logan Sargeant Alfa Romeo Racing with Valtteri Bottas and Guanyu Zhou Haas F1 Team with Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg As you can see from the above list, only one entity is listed as a team in each of the ten teams. It means that either the teams are constructing the cars by themselves or the engine and chassis builders have handed over the intellectual rights to the teams. Advertisement Formula 1 Drivers Formula One drivers are as fit as most athletes in any sport. They have very high stamina and extremely good reflexes. Driving a race is very demanding both physically and mentally. That is why drivers dedicate a lot of time both during the season and otherwise maintaining their physical health and well-being. All F1 drivers lose weight at the end of a race. That is because a lot of energy is spent by the drivers in working the brake and throttle pedals and concentrating on the track. Much energy is also spent when countering the G-force on the bends and sharp corners. G-force is the force an F1 driver experiences when he accelerates or the car is going around a bend or a corner on the track. F1 drivers will experience a force of 2G when accelerating and up to 6G on a sharp corner. It means that the drivers are pulled by a force equal to 6 times their weight. Although a drivers\u2019 body is firmly strapped in his seat, their neck, as well as their legs, are free to move. Keeping legs and neck in position under these high g-forces takes a lot of strength and effort. That is why F1 drivers assign a high priority to strengthen their neck muscles for high endurance. Advertisement Formula 1 Circuits A Formula One circuit is a loop of a road that is approved by the FIA as a race track fit for F1 racing. A circuit usually starts with a straight stretch and has several turns and corners. Most circuits run in a clockwise direction. Those few that are anticlockwise give drivers the most trouble because of G-force on their necks in a direction that they are used to. The average time taken for a race is 2 hours and the average distance of a circuit is 305 km (190 miles). But the distance varies in the length of the track from circuit to circuit as does the difficulty in negotiating the circuit. One round around a circuit is counted as one lap and races are usually specified as the number of laps of a particular circuit. For example, Monaco is a slow circuit and the distance of the race is 260 km (161.7) miles. Monaco also has the shortest track length of 3.34 km (2.075 miles). Although the average length of a circuit is 5 km (3.1 miles), the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, at 7 km (4.352 miles), is considerably longer than the other tracks.

Austrian Grand Prix 1964 1 Advertisement Pits and Pit Stops Pit stops are essential for cars to change tyres and for making repairs, mechanical adjustments, refuelling or as a penalty. Refuelling is not allowed in F1 for now. However, drivers have to make at least one pit stop to change tyres because F1 tyres are designed to last much less than the distance of one race. Pits are located at the side of racing lanes and they are assigned in the order of qualifying rankings of the team. A pit may have even up to twenty mechanics who prepare for all eventualities one lap before the car makes a pit stop. Drivers make a call on taking a pit stop depending on the state of their tyres and any mechanical repairs or adjustments their car might need. The team leader in the pit will usually remind the driver that he has to make a pit stop one lap before a pre-scheduled stop. The less the number of pit stops drivers make, the more advantage they get in race times. Advertisement Formula 1 Seasons A season of Formula One consists of a number of Grands Prix conducted over the course of a year. The F1 season usually starts in March and ends in December. There are 23 venues across the world where the Grands Prix are held. The 2023 FORMULA 1 calendar will feature 23 races, including a debut race at the new street circuit in Las Vegas. The Chinese Grand Prix has once again been removed from the calendar due to the covid testing and isolation requirements that would not suit the needs of F1. At the end of the F1 season, the World Drivers\u2019 Championship and the Constructors\u2019 Championship are awarded to the winners. The drivers\u2019 championship is decided by the cumulative number of points the driver has accumulated in that season. The constructors\u2019 championship goes to the team with the highest total of the points accumulated by both its drivers during the season. Advertisement Slang Terms Used in Formula One Now that you have got the hang of what F1 is about let us go to some of the slang used in F1. The words listed below are some of the technical jargon used by team staff and commentators. Once you know them, you will be in a better position to understand what some \u2018expert commentators\u2019 are talking about when they say \u2018marbles\u2019 and \u2018polesitter\u2019. Backmarker Trailing drivers are often lapped by the leading drivers. The trailing drivers are referred to as backmarkers just as we refer to back benchers in schools and colleges. Blistering/Graining Blistering is when the cold surface of the track causes pieces to blow out of the tyre surface because the inside of the tyre is warmer. Graining is just the opposite. It is a situation when the tyres are cold and the hotter surface outside causes the rubber chunks to come off and stick to the tyre. Bottoming Out When the underside of the car comes in contact with the track, it is referred to as bottoming. It happens because of uneven tracks and in cases of sudden rise or crest. You get a shower of sparks when a car bottoms out because F1 cars use titanium skid blocks underneath their chassis. Box \u2018Box\u2019 is a reminder to the drivers coming from a controller in the pits that they have a pit stop coming during the lap or in the next lap. The word is derived from the German word \u2018Boxenstopp\u2019 which means a pit stop. Brake Bias Brake bias is what allows the drivers to adjust the difference between how much the front wheels and the rear wheels brake. Normally, both the front and rear wheels will break equally when the driver pushes down on the brake pedal. In wet conditions, the driver may want to increase the braking in the rear tyres and reduce it in the front wheels. Drivers adjust brake biases throughout the course of a race to balance the car depending on the condition of the tyres and the amount of fuel left in the tanks. Dirty Air/Clean Air Dirty air is the turbulent air left in the wake of the preceding car. The car coming in the wake of the leading car will experience a drag because of the dirty air. Clean air is the undisturbed air encountered by a car speeding all on its own. The air flows smoothly around the car\u2019s streamlined surface but leaves dirty air in its wake. DRS Drag Reduction System (DRS) is allowed to be used in only marked zones on the track. Turbulent air behind the leading car can lead to a drag on the car following it closely, reducing the downforce. A flap on the car is then used to reduce the drag and increase the downforce which can help the car in overtaking on a straight. Falling Off the Cliff Falling off the cliff describes the situation when the tyre compounds deteriorate unusually rapidly during the race. Ths slows down the car and renders it uncompetitive. Drivers say \u201c my tyres fell off the cliff and I had to pit stop early\u201d to describe their predicament. Flatspot When a car driver locks his front brakes, the front tyres skid along the surface of the track rather than roll across it. This wears the tyres giving it a prominent flat spot. A flat spot on the tyres results in unscheduled pit stops spoiling the chances of the driver in the race. Green Track A green track is an almost unused track that drivers encounter on the first day of practice. The track has little rubber laid down onto it affording the cars less than optimum traction on the dry. Lift and Coast If a driver feels that he is going to run out of fuel before the end of the race, he has to conserve his fuel. The driver then lifts off the throttle and cruises. The driver is said to be \u2018lifting and coasting\u201d into the braking zone at the cost of speed. Marbles Tiny pieces of rubber that are shredded off the tyres while cornering are called marbles. They accumulate off the racing line and driving on them can be dangerous as the car loses traction. Oversteer/Understeer When a car is cornering and the rear wheels of the car lose grip and step out of line, the driver is said to have oversteered. On the other hand, if the front wheels lose grip and the car takes a shallower turn than the driver intended, the car has been understeered. Polesitter A polesitter is the driver who sets the fastest lap in Q3 of the qualifying sessions. Pole sitters have an advantage if they get away from the pack and hold the lead into the first corner. Power Unit The engine of a modern-day F1 car has \u2018power units\u2019 rather than just engines as in the olden days. This unit consists of six components. The Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), the Turbo Charger (TC), the Motor Generator Unit \u2013 H (MGU-H), Motor Generator Unit \u2013 Kinetic (MGU-K), the Energy Store (ES) and the Control Electronics (CE) taken together is called the Power Unit. These components combine to give an F1 car just below 1000 bhp of power. Tankslapper A driver is said to have got a tankslapper when a sideways movement causes the rear end of the car to step out of line. Advertisement Why Should You Attend a Grand Prix? Each Grand Prix is held over three days, from Friday to Sunday, except in Monaco where the Friday practice sessions are held on a Thursday. The action starts on Fridays and culminates in the crowning event, the race on Sundays. Between Friday and Sunday, there are practice and qualifying sessions that set the scene for the race on Sunday. Practice Sessions Practice sessions usually start on Fridays and last till Saturday mornings. If the races are scheduled to be held at night, the timings of the practice sessions may vary. Practice sessions are for individual teams and their drivers to familiarise themselves with the track and fine-tune their cars. During practice sessions, the drivers will try out different types of tyres on the track to find out how long they last. They will also keep a close watch on their fuel consumption with different tyres and tune their engines accordingly. Drivers use the practice sessions to get a good feel of the track and the car. They will use this knowledge to get a good position in the qualifying rounds. Watching the practice sessions will let you identify the different cars and drivers during the race. It also gives you a chance to watch all the behind the scenes activities. Qualifying Sessions Qualifying sessions are the most exciting experience you will get on a racing weekend. Generally held on Saturday afternoons, there are three qualifying phases Q1, Q2 and Q3. During qualifying sessions, drivers will push their machines to the brink in order to get a good position on the grid. In Q1, or the first qualifying round all the 20 cars (if there are 20 cars participating) will take part. The five cars finishing last will be eliminated from any further qualification sessions. They will take the grid positions from 16 to 20 depending on their timings in Q1. The remaining 15 cars will participate in the Q2 session. In this session a further five cars that finish last will be eliminated from the last qualifying session. They will take grid positions according to their performance in the Q2 session. Q3 is the last qualifying session and decides the grid position for the remaining 10 cars. In this session, drivers will really work their throttles during this session in a bid to win the pole position. The pole position is considered a distinct advantage. The polesitter gets an unencumbered track and clean air to take a lead which many times tends to be unassailable. That is why qualification sessions are considered to be the most exciting time of a racing weekend. The Race After the grid is set in qualifying, barring any penalties either for wrongdoing or technical changes to the car, the grid will start how they ended qualifying. The cars come out early for an installation lap, then grid up, where they are assessed by the team, and the drivers have an anxious wait as the clock ticks down until the race begins. During this time some will be interviewed, some listen to music, and drivers like the affable Kimi Raikkonen avoid eye contact with anyone as they get into the zone. After a \u2018parade lap\u2019 of the drivers being driven around the track to wave to the crowd, they fire up the cars and complete a warm-up lap behind the safety car. At the completion of the warm-up lap, the starter waits for the signal, then it\u2019s lights out and away we go! The first corner is always a nerve-jangling time, more so for team bosses and those of us watching, than it is for the drivers. After a frantic opening lap, it is then time to settle down and race to the chequered flag. Advertisement Things Taking Place During a Racing Weekend Support Races Support races feature in most GP weekends. Young drivers who are tomorrow going to take the place of F1 drivers compete in F2 and F3 races. These races can be quite intense and make for good watching. You never know if you can spot a youngster who might feature in the next year\u2019s FI race. Pit Lane Walks If you are just getting familiar with F1 and happen to attend a F1 weekend, try not to miss the pit lane walk experience. A pit lane walk will give you a fair idea of what work goes on behind the scenes in F1. You will see drivers and mechanics fine tuning their cars for the race. You may even get a chance to take a selfie with a F1 driver or a mechanic of your favourite team. Pit lane walks are however high in demand and you will have to buy tickets that include pit lane walks. Advertisement Get to Know F1 Better When you are new to Formula One, it is easy to feel left out and you are left wondering when you will gain some level of expertise in the sport. There are plenty of forums on the internet where you can greatly enhance your knowledge on F1. Here is a list of places where you can increase your F1 knowledge quickly. After reading through this Beginners Guide to Formula 1 you\u2019re now up to speed with the intricacies of the sport, so it\u2019s time to choose your favourite team and driver!

                "text": "What Are the Pros and Cons of Video Games? Video games have become one of the world\u2019s favorite pastimes. There are almost 3 billion gamers worldwide in 2021, with gaming prevalence continuing to grow every year. Gaming is not without controversy, though.

On the surface, these pros of video games look appealing. Still, it\u2019s important to remember that these positive effects of video games come with a catch: they can be far outweighed by the cons if gaming becomes an addiction.

In the study, one group was made up of gamers, while the other group was non-gamers. Both groups received the same questionnaire with questions and assignments that would test their cognitive abilities. The group of gamers showed better results in almost every field of the test. Games Improve Problem-Solving Skills and Logic Video games involve a lot of critical thinking, problem-solving, and the use of logic. As a gamer, you have to work your way through the game by using specific skills to achieve the game\u2019s goals. Gamers have more grey matter and better brain connectivity than non-gamers, resulting from extensive playtime requiring problem-solving skills. Developing these skills in video games may translate into better job performance or improved performance in school. Improved Hand-to-Eye Coordination Playing video games improves your hand-to-eye coordination, making you more capable of performing tasks that involve coordination of your eyes and your hands. These tasks can include everything from everyday tasks such as driving, typing, or performing manual tasks with your hands to professional skills like performing surgeries. These improvements were confirmed by a study from 2007, which involved laparoscopic surgery trainees that also played video games. The study found that surgeons who played video games regularly had higher accuracy and could complete tasks faster than non-gamers. Faster and More Accurate Decision-Making Another pro of gaming is the ability to make more accurate decisions in a much quicker fashion. Players of video games will tell you that several games prompt you to make your decisions quickly based on the information you receive from the game itself. Fast-paced games, in particular, contributed to a gamer\u2019s ability to make quick decisions. Some games, especially competitive ones where you play against other players, can be punishing if you make a wrong decision. For example, the game Call of Duty involves fast-paced action, and you need to make the right decisions at the right time to win. Again, this skill can be crucial in several fields of work, such as in the army or in the hospital, where you need to make fast and accurate decisions based on the facts and information you have, especially when you have limited time. You See More Detail Video games and eyesight quality is still a hotly debated topic. Some studies tell us that excessive screen time causes eyestrain and might even hurt your eyes. In contrast, other studies show us that video games can improve your ability to see details in your sight, especially in your periphery. Studies that show excessive screen time is harmful find you may experience negative effects such as eye strain, headaches, loss of focus flexibility, nearsightedness, and even retinal damage. On the other hand, playing video games might improve your ability to see more details in your eyesight, especially in your periphery. This development of your eyes might help you drive better and perform various tasks that include driving. It\u2019s essential to stay within the recommended screen time guidelines for all ages since too much screen time may cause damage to your eyes. However, if you play games in moderation, you might even be able to see some positive effects on your eyesight. Games Promote Social Activity and Teamwork Video games can promote teamwork and social engagement with other players, making it a modern form of socialization for kids and young adults. Some games can force you to cooperate with other players, making video games a beneficial exercise for team-building and establishing social connections with other players. Also, several games present the opportunity to make new friends and connect to them in ways that no other medium does, including the chance to meet people from all over the world. However, excessive playtime can lead to increased isolation and loneliness, which are linked to mental health problems like depression and social anxiety. Although gaming is a social outlet for many individuals, and making new friends from different cultures is possible, a balance of in-game contacts and real-life friendships is crucial. Cons of Video Games Despite several benefits of playing video games, there are also many disadvantages of video games that might impact the quality of your life. These are the most common cons of video games: Video games can make you addicted Elevated risk of aggression Games replace real-world problems Some games promote gambling Decreased physical and mental health Lack of focus and concentration As good as the positive effects of games might be, the negative effects of video games can outweigh the pros if you develop a gaming addiction. Video Games Can Make You Addicted The first and the biggest problem with video games is that they can make you addicted. Video game addiction is a rising problem and likely to increase in the future. The World Health Organization has recognized gaming disorder as an actual mental health condition, and global prevalence is around 3-4% of gamers. Considering that there are about 3 billion gamers globally, the number of addicted gamers is estimated to be between 90 \u2013 100 million. One of the main reasons behind the pandemic of video game addiction is that video games are designed to be addictive. They provide instant gratification and encourage gamers to keep playing every day. Players who play every day may even receive bonuses and special rewards in encouraging them to play even more. But the concept of addictive video games is even more complicated. They manipulate several aspects of our psychology, such as: Progression of our in-game character, which replaces real-life personal development Loot boxes, microtransactions, and in-app purchases encourage you to keep spending more money Socializing virtually with other players replaces real-world friendships and connections In-game mechanics that link gaming to gambling Once a video game becomes an addiction, it will far outweigh all the pros of video games. It will impact your professional life, personal development, and interpersonal relations. If you feel like you or someone you know is addicted to video games, feel free to try some of the programs and resources we have on Game Quitters: Elevated Risk of Aggression Several studies (1, 2, 3) have shown that video games are a risk factor behind aggression. However, the studies also found that video games are not the only factor behind this aggression. Video games might increase the risk of aggression in an individual in combination with other factors. There\u2019s also a stigma around video games promoted by the media, which says that video games are violent and promote violence. But it\u2019s far too easy to pin this problem down solely to video games, although they can be a contributing factor. Although the link between video games and violence is still hotly contested, many parents report increased aggression in their children when playing excessively, including damaging property. Therefore, parents should be mindful to ensure their children play age-appropriate games and seek professional support if they experience increasingly aggressive behavior. Games Can Replace Real-World Problems One of the main problems with playing video games too much is that they neglect other key areas of one\u2019s life, such as one\u2019s personal or professional life. It\u2019s a safe place to fail, and it presents an easy way to escape real-world problems. Although escaping from stress is not necessarily bad, the problem occurs when gamers start to neglect other critical aspects of their real life. When that happens, it might be time to consider limiting your playtime, replacing it with other activities, and dealing with your life problems. Some Games Promote Gambling Modern video games are linked to gambling through loot boxes and microtransactions that promote compulsive spending. Gamers who suffer from gaming addiction can also develop a gambling addiction, exacerbated by the seeming ease of access to gambling-like mechanics inside modern games. Many of these games are played by kids, meaning that children have access to gambling mechanics using real-life money. Parents report discovering hundreds or even thousands of dollars spent on their credit cards without their knowledge. Gamers Can Develop Physical or Mental Health Issues Excessive game time can lead to physical and mental health issues, which include: Depression and social anxiety Lack of motivation Poor emotional regulation Poor sleep hygiene Muscle loss and fat gain Dehydration Exhaustion It\u2019s important to take a closer look if you develop any of these symptoms; you may want to consider video game addiction therapy if you do. Lack of Concentration Spending a long time in front of a screen playing games can impact a gamer\u2019s ability to focus and concentrate on other tasks such as school, work, college, or study. Games demand a lot of attention to detail and concentration. But, unfortunately, we\u2019re only able to focus for a certain amount of time daily, and the more time you spend gaming, the less attention you will have for other tasks. Conclusion The pros and cons of video games are interlinked and will differ from one gamer to another. There are some positive benefits of games when played in moderation. However, there are also negative effects if played excessively. You should always be aware of the cons of games, and if you notice the first signs of these cons developing, you should consider moderating your gaming or seek help to prevent further problems with gaming addiction."

                "text": "For years, researchers have studied the effects of sound on the human brain. Specifically, people have tried to understand why certain sounds alter someone\u2019s mood, physical sensations, and even memory. The most common example of this phenomenon is music. It\u2019s a form of art and tradition inherent to every known culture on Earth, and in some cases music (particularly the use of chants, horns, and drums) predates organized language. The human brain attunes to sound in the womb somewhere between 16 and 18 weeks. And a newborn\u2019s sense of hearing develops faster than other senses, even extending to tuning out or \u201cunlistening\u201d to specific sounds. This suggests that humans have a predilection for sound, with certain parts of our brain prioritizing audio-triggered responses. All of these findings have led to a heightened focus on understanding our obsession with sound, both as a component of modern cultures and also as a key piece of brain development. And this particular field of neuroscience \u2014 often grouped with psychoacoustics \u2014 has led to changes in both administered therapy and everyday self-care. To fully appreciate the psychology of music, you can break the topic down into three key categories: how our brains process sound, how music affects the brain, and how music therapy can be used to improve anyone\u2019s life. How Our Brains Process Sound Music is a powerful and often emotional experience for many people, yet so few of us fully appreciate how specific sounds affect our mood. But before we explore the physiology of music\u2019s effect on the brain, it\u2019s important to understand how our bodies interact with sound as a whole. Put simply, our body perceives sound as vibrations and translates those signals to electric pulses. While that might not seem particularly \u201csimple\u201d \u2014 in fact it is one of the more complex things our bodies do each day \u2014 scientists have unraveled the principle stages of how sound moves from the source to the brain. A Quick Look At Sound Waves Everyone is familiar with the concept of sound waves, but sound can also travel as a set of pulses; these are the two primary patterns that sounds take as they travel. When these pressure variations travel through a specific material (usually air), they push and compress the molecules in their path and take a very specific shape. Those pulses spread as they travel, growing wider and taller with time. As this cone expands, the pressure weakens and the sound becomes diluted or less powerful, which affects how clearly we are able to hear them. But that original \u201cshape\u201d remains. With this mental image, it\u2019s easy to see how \u201csound\u201d quickly becomes \u201cnoise.\u201d Crowded streets are full of competing pulses, while a single sound travels differently through air as compared to another medium like water or rock. Music is an even more complicated set of audio signals because it can consist of sounds from multiple sources, at multiple frequencies, and sometimes even from multiple directions. And the way sound travels becomes even more complex when we think about hearing range, sound diffusion, and how different sources create different sound wave shapes. The Power Of The Human Ear \u201cHearing\u201d truly begins when sound waves pass through the ear canal and reach the eardrum. Our bodies receive and process sound in three different stages: the signal of a specific sound travels into the outer ear (eardrum), is transcribed by the middle ear (ossicles), and is broadcast to the inner ear (cochlea) where it passes on to the brain. Once sound waves reach the eardrum, a delicate set of organs and bones get to work. These pieces function similarly to a stopwatch or even a computer hard drive, with a dozen different minuscule components working in tandem over the course of a microsecond. As each sound wave reaches the outer ear, it causes the eardrum to vibrate like a strummed rubber band. This movement shifts then three tiny bones \u2014 the smallest in the human body, in fact \u2014 which amplifies those vibrations as they pass on to the cochlea. The cochlea, which has a shape similar to a nautilus shell, is lined with tiny hairs. And as the sound vibrations reach different sections of the cochlea, these hairs \u2014 called stereocilia \u2014 move up and town. That, in turn, opens up pores that release neurotransmitters into a nerve connecting the cochlea to the brain. Finally, those chemicals travel along the auditory nerve and are received, processed, and recognized by the brain as specific sounds. All of that happens at near-instantaneous speeds every millisecond of every day, regardless of whether we are awake or asleep. This video from the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communications Disorders animates the entire process from start to finish: Sound signals affect many sections of the brain, but each area reacts differently based on how the brain categorizes the auditory signal. Music in particular takes full advantage of that process by generating a wide variety of mental, emotional, and physical reactions. And it is that variety that makes the psychology of music a focal point for many scientific studies. How Our Brains Respond To Music Multiple sound sources often create \u201cnoise\u201d that muddy our brain\u2019s ability to single out and process specific sounds. That is especially true with sounds at varying decibels and wavelengths, similar to the illustration of a busy city street. Music, however, is both a simple sound and a complex amalgamation of different sounds. Yet \u2014 when properly arranged \u2014 the human brain is able to receive that signal and then separate the individual instruments and vocals. It can also recognize specific music chords or notes, understand multiple sets of lyrics, and physically react to the beat, all at the same time. Those levels of complexity add to the artfulness of music and how songs are composed and arranged to generate emotions and pleasure. But before we can explore the art of music and the different ways it can be used to improve our lives, we need to understand the many ways that music interacts with our brains. Scientists have singled out a dozen different areas of the brain that respond to music, but five regions have the most significant impact on the listener. They are the: Temporal lobe Amygdala Frontal lobe Cerebellum Hippocampus We\u2019ll look at each of these separately to see how sound (and specifically music) can affect the brain\u2019s natural physiological purpose. How Music Affects The Temporal Lobe The temporal lobe serves a variety of roles, and one of them is language comprehension. This plays an important part in how we hear and react to the world around us, particularly in regards to conversation. As our brain\u2019s language center, the temporal lobe allows us to understand song lyrics. The temporal lobe is constantly engaged when we listen to music \u2014 even songs without lyrics. The temporal lobe functions as the processing center for music, but two of its subregions allow us to further enjoy what we hear. Wernicke\u2019s area is the part of the brain that analyzes and comprehends what we hear, turning the words of a song into specific phrases and stories. Meanwhile, Broca\u2019s area gives us the ability to form our words ourselves so we can sing along with the music or discuss what we are hearing. How Music Affects The Amygdala While the amygdala is tucked within the temporal lobe, it serves a purpose that makes it stand apart. The amygdala is the emotional switchboard of the brain, managing both negative emotions (fear or displeasure) as well as positive emotions (enthusiasm or tranquility). The amygdala ties into the \u201cfight or flight\u201d instinct of the brain; it is the part of the brain that processes sounds and determines our emotional reactions to them. So while the amygdala can alert someone to an approaching ambulance or an angry dog, it is also the part that makes us smile when we hear a familiar voice or the calming songs of rainfall. The amygdala\u2019s connection to music is an obvious one, and studies show that responses to certain music genres are almost universal. Music can trigger those same emotional cues as the sounds mentioned above: a horror film soundtrack elicits an almost primal fear, while a soaring battle march can create a surge of excitement. Similarly, meditation music can soothe the mind and body to produce a calming effect. And a plucky pop song can force an easy smile, regardless of the listener\u2019s previous mood. All of these physiological responses to music stem from the amygdala. How Music Affects The Frontal Lobe The frontal lobe, on the other hand, is where we do our thinking, planning, and reasoning. While neurologists have yet to fully understand how music affects the frontal lobe, we do know that our interests and opinions about music \u2014 and specifically our tastes in genres and songs \u2014 stem from frontal lobe activity. Research shows that the frontal lobe functions as a hub for how we respond to certain music. Those specifics continue to be the focus of much study, but this area of the brain is a frequent focus for music therapists. How Music Affects The Cerebellum A normal byproduct to music is movement, and that is tied directly to the cerebellum. Whether that means tapping a foot, dancing a jig, or strumming an air guitar, the cerebellum is the part of the brain that triggers and coordinates movement in response to (or in time with) music. Playing instruments also relies entirely on this part of the brain. Studies have shown that even a few weeks of piano lessons can alter the cerebellum. In fact, those functional changes aren\u2019t restricted to playing music \u2014 listening to music or even imagining playing the piano can have the same effect. The cerebellum also manages muscle memory. While a person\u2019s cognitive abilities and long-term memory can fade over time, the cerebellum \u2014 as a separate part of the brain \u2014 ages differently. This has led to stories of coma victims reacting to music, Alzheimer\u2019s patients playing instruments, and stroke victims finding their voice through song. As a result, the cerebellum is particularly valuable for many forms of music therapy. How Music Affects The Hippocampus Listening to music does not only have a transient effect on the brain; research shows that hearing or playing music alters both brain structure and brain function, particularly in situations where the same music is played frequently. This is because the hippocampus serves as a total contrast to the cerebellum. As the brain\u2019s memory center, the hippocampus is in charge of storing information. It also regulates emotional responses to certain things, which can be tied to memories associated with similar triggers. Multiple scientific studies on the hippocampus have shown a strong tie between music listening, long-term memory, and short-term memory. The repetitive nature of music, with its motifs and phrases, activates short-term memory while simultaneously building long-term memories. That\u2019s why people can remember a song they heard on the radio the previous day, but then 30 years later they also remember the outfit they wore and who else was in the car when they heard that song. This effect can vary based upon the type of music being played. And that gives further credit to the idea that music can be a powerfully influential force on brain function. Music can be written to target different brain regions, which in turn elicit different reactions from the listener. While that allows musicians and composers to create truly moving pieces of music, it is proof that music can be a valuable tool for healthcare providers. Music As A Therapy Tool New studies continue to showcase music\u2019s effects on the brain. As a result, music therapy has become an increasingly valuable tool for helping patients with all sorts of injuries and negative life experiences. While trauma of any sort can lead to different types of brain atrophy, we now know that music can have the opposite effect; it may not fully repair damaged brain tissue, but music therapy can help create new pathways to compensate for that loss. A 2018 study proved that changes in brain function (caused by listening to music) activates specific areas of the brain, which can promote healing. And that healing can take a variety of forms, such as reduced depression, improved abstract thinking, heightened motivation, etc. That study went on to suggest that music therapy could be used to deal with anything from \u201csubjective distress experience in chronic pain syndromes, to the reward circuitry involved in addictive disorders, to the psychomotor pathways involved in Parkinson\u2019s disease, and even to the functional connectivity changes that occur in autism spectrum disorders.\u201d That is not to say that music is some sort of mystical cure-all for every ailment. But there is evidence that implementation of music therapy can succeed as a means of giving people strength as they undergo surgery, chemotherapy, and other complicated treatment regimens. These outcomes can provide encouraging results for many people, but future studies will be required to show the lasting effects of music therapy. Creating new pathways through the brain could circumvent damaged tissue, thereby restoring previously lost functions. So while music therapy may never provide a path to reverting neurological disorders, there are still obvious benefits from incorporating music into a patient\u2019s therapeutic habits. The History Of Music Therapy Music therapy dates back all the way to Ancient Greece \u2014 specifically the writings of Plato and Aristotle \u2014 and there are earlier records of music being used in ritualistic healings around the world. However, the first scientific papers on the topic began to appear in the late 1700s. The earliest modern implementations of music therapy were immediately following World War II. Musicians would perform for hospitalized veterans as a means to raise their spirits and help them deal with psychological trauma that they carried home from those battlefields. But the benefits of these performances were so significant that doctors began to study the impact of music on mental health. Over the next few decades, this research led many therapists to dedicate their whole careers to studying the psychology of music. Some of the music therapy pioneers were Isa Maud Ilsen (founder of the National Association of Music in Hospitals), Harriet Ayer Seymour (founder of the National Foundation of Music Therapy), E. Thayer Gaston (considered the \u201cfather of music therapy\u201d), and Ira Altshuler, whose efforts led to the first collegiate music therapy training program. All of those individual efforts culminated in the founding of the American Music Therapy Association in 1998. This association is an advocate for promoting music therapy across the government and academia, and it eventually grew to become the main hub for music therapy research, education, and resources throughout the United States and more than 30 other countries. Popular Uses For Music Therapy Music therapy can deliver a wide range of positive results, including but not limited to self-discovery, self-expression, and self-healing. But music can also bring a sense of community through performances both in-person and remote. Patients are able to practice this form of therapy long after they\u2019ve completed their prescribed care regimen. While music therapy is most effective when paired with other practices \u2014 like exercise, counseling, and social support \u2014 it can be used independently without sacrificing results. Popular implementations of music therapy include: At the core of these practices is a singular fact: Music\u2019s ability to alter brain function provides therapists with a valuable and repeatable tool. The ability to improve a patient\u2019s mood and create a calm environment \u2014 regardless of the patient\u2019s health \u2014 has helped integrate music therapy into most mental health providers. It also solidifies the importance of music in our culture. Music can be used as a form of natural therapy for many different diseases, even showing benefits for those with severe physical or cognitive impairments regardless of age or mental health status. Recently, the University of Miami Health System implemented a music therapy program as part of their cancer treatment practice. The goal of this is to use all sides of music \u2014 writing, listening, playing, and singing \u2014 to activate different parts of the brain in whatever way each patient prefers. Because of that flexibility, patients have been able to find comfort and strength through music therapy even during COVID-induced quarantine. And as further study is done on the topic of the psychology of music, it is safe to assume that we will see new ways to implement music into therapy regimens. As a result, music therapy will only grow in importance. Understanding The Psychology Of Music The psychology of music really comes down to how the brain processes sound, how music affects different parts of the brain, and how music therapy can be implemented. But perhaps the most significant and universal outcome of music therapy is that, at its core, music brings joy. Listening to music triggers the same pleasure centers as eating a favorite food, exercising, or even having sex. This is a core reason behind why music therapy has become such a widespread inclusion from many mental health practices. And that remains true even in spite of a global pandemic; in fact, mandated quarantine made music even more important. For many people, listening to music provided a way to manage global increases in anxiety, loneliness, and depression. So whether it is a means of reducing the effects of epilepsy, relieving the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease, or even learning a new language, music has the power to improve a person\u2019s life. And understanding how that can be implemented into mental health routines makes it a topic worth studying, understanding, and practicing."

There is a noise that, for a Navy captain, may well be the worst sound imaginable\u2014worse than the boom of cannon fire, the whistle of a missile, or the whoosh of a torpedo. That noise is the long, piercing scrape of metal against rock. It\u2019s the sound, quite simply, of everything going wrong. Edward Howe Watson heard that noise on September 8, 1923, at 9:05 p.m., while sitting in his ship\u2019s quarters, directly beneath the bridge of the United States Navy destroyer Delphy. Watson was a 49-year-old naval commander\u2014a privileged and pedigreed, blue-blooded son of an admiral, Kentucky born and Annapolis trained. A year earlier, he\u2019d taken command of the Delphy\u2019s entire squadron of 19 destroyers. This had been a promotion, a welcome sign of forward momentum in a long and varied Navy career. Privately, Watson told his wife that he\u2019d have preferred a battleship. But he seemed just one promotion away from getting that too, and after that perhaps an admiralty, like his father before him. The Delphy had left San Francisco that morning and spent the day speeding south along the coast of California. Thirteen more ships in Watson\u2019s squadron trailed behind. The destination was their home port in San Diego. This was a training exercise\u2014a speed trial, the sort of thing the Navy, under considerable budget pressures, hadn\u2019t tried since the war. All day the destroyers maintained top speeds in challenging conditions: bad weather, massive waves, a civilian vessel requiring rescue. By late afternoon, no one on any of the ships could make out the coastline through the haze. Watson wasn\u2019t concerned; he had one of the Navy\u2019s best navigators for the Delphy\u2019s skipper, and he was using dead reckoning\u2014the time-tested technique of calculating location from a ship\u2019s compass direction, estimated speed, and the amount of time traveled\u2014to ensure that they were where they needed to be. Best of all, a rival squadron of destroyers, part of the same training exercise, were making worse time. Watson was winning the race. By nightfall, the Delphy was coming close to the Santa Barbara Channel, with San Diego in reach by dawn. A few minutes before 9 p.m., Watson ordered a turn east toward the coast for the final approach into the channel. The entrance was a risky place for a squadron traveling at 20 knots\u2014littered with rocks, reefs, and shipwrecks just beneath the water\u2019s surface\u2014but it was the shortest route, and using it all but guaranteed that Watson would win. The other ships would follow, and they\u2019d all be home in record time. That was when Watson heard the noise\u2014first the scrape, and then a thunderous boom. In that flash of a moment, Watson knew. They were running aground. Careers would be destroyed, reputations and legacies wiped away\u2014and, worst of all, lives could be lost. But he could not have known that what happened next would become the greatest peacetime disaster in the history of the U.S. Navy. That it would prompt a court-martial of 11 officers, also the largest of its kind in history. And that, in the aftermath, he would be forced to rethink everything he believed about the price of honor and the true meaning of leadership. And that, even now, 100 years later, there would be no end to the arguments over who exactly was to blame. The destroyers under Watson\u2019s command were known as four-stackers, marked by a quartet of tall, identical cylinders arrayed neatly in a line down the ship\u2019s center, like the bristles of a toothbrush. Each ship was 314 feet long and 32 feet wide, nimble and powerful enough to target German submarines during the First World War. But by the time Watson took command of Squadron 11 in 1922, the war was over, fuel was being rationed, and military funding had been slashed across the board. While four-stackers could carry as many as 131 men, budget cuts reduced the number on board to roughly 100. It was an unfortunate time to be rising in the Navy. America may have just won a war, but the nation\u2019s reputation was fragile. Washington was a hotbed of corruption; President Warren Harding\u2019s Teapot Dome bribery scandal had implicated naval secretary Edwin Denby. Now more than ever, the Navy needed a demonstration of confidence, of authority. And Watson needed the Navy, too, in his own way. Watson had grown up amid privilege, his only care, perhaps, the burden of expectation. He was the eldest son of a powerful Kentucky family, a member of America\u2019s brand of aristocracy. One of his great-grandfathers had served as governor, was a five-term U.S. senator, and advised two presidents. The family superstar was his father, John Crittenden Watson, who earned his place in history as a Union Navy lieutenant during the Civil War battle of Mobile Bay. In 1864, Captain James Farragut of the battleship Hartford led a squadron of ships into Confederate waters and shocked everyone around him when he ordered his fleet into a mine-strewn waterway, crying out, \u201cDamn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!\u201d Watson\u2019s father was Farragut\u2019s faithful aide-de-camp. He\u2019d heard the captain say it, and quoted him for years afterward, codifying the legend. Watson grew up with that story, which was also becoming the Navy\u2019s story\u2014the daring squadron commander defying all odds, cheating death, seizing his place in the world. He entered the Navy in his father\u2019s shadow: The elder Watson went on to be an admiral, and often told the tale of how he\u2019d been the one to lash Farragut to the Hartford\u2019s rigging, so his body would be found if the ship went down. Between the younger Watson\u2019s many postings\u2014on the Amphitrite, the Maine, the Brooklyn, the Baltimore, the Richmond, the Prairie, the West Virginia, the Detroit, the Iris\u2014his father would step in and offer plum assignments; Watson even went along as his father\u2019s aide to the coronation of King Edward in London. He married well\u2014a St. Louis socialite named Hermine Gratz, whose sister married a Rockefeller\u2014and a life of ease awaited once his time in the Navy ended. But during the Great War, Watson only managed to take command of a battleship late in the effort, and he never saw combat. So when the destroyers of his squadron were given a chance to prove their worth, the opportunity couldn\u2019t have come soon enough. On Friday, September 7, 1923, Watson summoned Squadron 11\u2019s commanders to a meeting. The ships were docked in San Francisco, where the crews were on shore leave. Watson announced that he\u2019d lead them to their home port in San Diego on a training exercise, coupled with gunnery and tactical drills. Their orders, Watson said, were to travel at 20 knots, faster than any ship had been permitted in years. For the first time since the war, these destroyers would do what they\u2019d been built to do, although it would come with some risk. There was no telling what toll such an extreme pace would take on the ships\u2019 turbines when sustained for 453 nautical miles. Watson shrugged off such concerns; that was what the exercise was for. Besides, Squadron 11 wouldn\u2019t be the only fleet of destroyers bound for San Diego that day. Squadron 12 was going, too. This would be a race, and Watson intended to win it. William L. Calhoun was ten years younger than Watson, in his late thirties, and a touch portly, with thinning blond hair. Like Watson, he had something of a pedigree: His great-grandfather was John C. Calhoun, the South Carolina senator who served as vice president under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. But unlike Watson, no one seemed to expect great things from Calhoun. He grew up in Palatka, Florida, and went to public school before scoring a spot at the Naval Academy. Calhoun once said that on his way out of town, a schoolteacher told him he wouldn\u2019t amount to anything. Calhoun proved that teacher wrong, working his way up from ensign to gunnery officer to chief engineer before switching to submarines, commanding a division of them during the war. He came home highly decorated in 1918, but endured several more humdrum postings before, in 1923, he was given command of a ship\u2014a destroyer in Watson\u2019s Squadron 11. If the new job intimidated Calhoun, he didn\u2019t show it. Aboard the ship, the young commander was something of a breath of fresh air, at least compared with his predecessor, whom many had found brusque. As a leader, Calhoun cultivated a mix of relentlessly demanding and personally appealing. The crew liked him straight away. They wanted to impress him. Then, in September, came the orders from Watson. After paying his dues and biding his time, Calhoun was facing his first trial as the skipper of his own ship. Eugene Dooman was in the lobby of the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco when he spotted his old friend Edward Watson. It was September 7, the same day Watson had given his squadron their orders. Dooman was a 32-year-old career diplomat who\u2019d been stationed at the American embassy in Tokyo for a decade. He\u2019d met Watson during the three years the captain lived there after the war, serving as a naval attach\u00e9. Watson and Dooman shared a love of Japanese culture and a fascination with the country\u2019s history and the traditions of its royal family. Now Dooman was at the start of a long leave back in America and glad for this chance meeting, because he was in a jam. Dooman had brought something bulky and valuable with him from Japan\u2014a heavy leather valise containing $3,000 in silver coins. This, oddly enough, would be his travel budget during his time away from Japan. Instead of paper money or a letter of credit, his bank in Tokyo persuaded him to accept silver; the bank would need to back up any large withdrawal with silver anyway, and if Dooman took it to America with him he\u2019d save the bank freight and insurance. For his trouble, the bank gave him an extra $400. Dooman hadn\u2019t counted on the bank being closed when he reached San Francisco. Worse yet, it was a Friday. Dooman would be stuck with a burdensome valise filled with silver until Monday, and he was scheduled to leave on Saturday for his next stop, Los Angeles. But now, in the hotel lobby with Watson, a solution presented itself. Watson told Dooman that he was taking his squadron to San Diego early the next morning, and he invited him along. It would require a little domestic diplomacy on Watson\u2019s part: His wife, Hermine, had asked him to bring their nine-year-old daughter, Clifford, on the Delphy, while she accompanied some friends on a road trip to San Diego. But Watson never warmed to the thought of having along a young girl on a destroyer. With just one available cabin on the ship, Dooman was a convenient excuse for Watson to change the plan. The diplomat said yes right away. The invitation neatly solved his problem. It would be easy enough to get a train to Los Angeles from the squadron\u2019s destination of San Diego, and Dooman\u2019s silver would be well protected during the journey. Watson cleared his guest through official channels, and Dooman arranged for a trunk with the rest of his belongings to be sent ahead to his hotel in Los Angeles. The next morning at 7 a.m., Dooman, valise in hand, arrived at the San Francisco Navy pier. The diplomat was ushered aboard the Delphy and into the guest cabin, where he changed into a heavy tweed suit to block the wind while on deck. He intended to enjoy the trip. Watson was coming up on 50 years old. This was a chance, maybe his last, to prove himself at sea. For Watson, it was no small thing to run into a friend from Tokyo. Japan was Watson\u2019s last posting before taking command of Squadron 11. His time there may have been the most successful of his career. Decades later, a colleague called Watson \u201cone of the most likable and dynamic, intelligent and alert naval attach\u00e9s we have had in any country.\u201d Watson arrived in Tokyo in 1919 with orders to monitor the country\u2019s designs on expansion. Japan had been making strides toward imperialism, and Washington was determined to maintain U.S. influence around the world after the war. Watson\u2019s predecessor left him with very little in the way of intel, forcing him to start with next to nothing. But after hosting parties for his Japanese counterparts, Watson discovered that he had a knack for eliciting information. His technique, as later described by an underling, was \u201ctelling them too much so that they could learn too little.\u201d Japanese officers found Watson\u2019s chattiness mystifying, and disarming. He produced memos full of policy insights\u2014many of which proved especially useful leading up to an international disarmament conference Japanese officials attended in Washington in late 1921. And he exposed attempts by the Japanese to bribe Navy officers for information. Watson was making a name for himself for the first time, excelling at a game his father, the illustrious Civil War hero, had never played\u2014a modern, 20th-century pastime, built for an age of global politics. Beyond his canny way with people, Watson also had a knack for seeing around corners. He insisted that the U.S. counter Japan\u2019s efforts to control the Pacific, and when Washington failed to follow some of his recommendations, he issued a dire prophecy. \u201cIf we know the minute details of Japanese plans for aggression,\u201d Watson said in 1922, \u201cwe are in a position to thwart them while they are still in the planning stage\u2026 Otherwise we shall one day be confronted with a surprise that will hit us right between the eyes.\u201d Watson seemed well positioned for the life of a diplomat, proto-spy, and statesman. All that ended abruptly when he received a promotion to command a squadron of destroyers. His career lurched back onto a familiar track\u2014his father\u2019s trajectory, the family business. Not without some regret, he returned home. Watson was coming up on 50 years old. This was a chance, maybe his last, to prove himself at sea. Now Watson\u2019s two paths were converging, or at least bumping up against each other for a day. At the very moment he was called upon to show his stuff as a naval commander, he also had the chance to catch up with a trusted colleague from his time in the Far East. The timing was even more welcome given how, just a week earlier, Japan had experienced a once-in-a-lifetime catastrophe. The great Kanto earthquake\u2014even today the most lethal natural disaster by far in the nation\u2019s history\u2014had laid waste to much of Yokohama and Tokyo, followed by typhoon-fueled fires and powerful tsunamis. More than 100,000 deaths were estimated, and Tokyo was under martial law. Many around the world, Watson included, were anxious to hear what had been destroyed, how many lives lost. On the water, he and Dooman would have time to talk about it all. 2. Patches of sun broke through the San Francisco fog on the morning of Saturday, September 8, as Watson\u2019s ships set off down the coast. Fourteen of the squadron\u2019s destroyers would take part in the exercise, divided into three divisions, with Watson aboard the Delphy in front. The Delphy would handle navigation for all the ships. The others would follow the leader, just like many great Navy squadrons before them, including Farragut\u2019s in Mobile Bay. They hit a wall of haze at 8 a.m., but the gunnery exercises took place as scheduled. At 11:30 a.m., the crew of the Delphy spotted a lighthouse at Pigeon Point, one of several shore locations ships used for a visual fix. All seemed well. But this would be the last time that day anyone would be able to see land. The weather was changing\u2014first fog, then more haze. For the rest of the afternoon, the Delphy\u2019s crew used dead reckoning to estimate its position. Lieutenant Commander Donald T. Hunter, the Delphy\u2019s skipper, had taught navigation for two years at the Naval Academy. The California shoreline did not present much of a challenge. Based on the ship\u2019s estimated speed of 20 knots and the typical currents, Hunter, working alongside the ship\u2019s navigator, Lieutenant Laurence Blodgett, calculated their location and continued hurtling down the coast. But a few hours passed and still no visibility. The Delphy had one more tool to assist with navigation: a radio device that allowed ships to request compass bearings from shore stations. Radio direction finding, or RDF, was still in its infancy\u2014it would be the precursor to radar, which wouldn\u2019t come to ships for more than a decade\u2014but the technology had been a great help during the war, detecting the location of German submarines when they surfaced to send wireless transmissions. After the war, RDF had been slow to catch on. While a number of lighthouses up and down the East and West Coast were equipped with it, ships like the Delphy had only a clunky-looking circular antenna on board. Upon request, a lighthouse worker would use an RDF device to send a signal to the ship\u2019s antenna, then contact the ship by traditional radio to provide a compass reading. If a lighthouse was, say, due east from a ship, a navigator could use that reading to calculate the ship\u2019s position. The system was far from ideal. There was, in fact, no way to tell which side of the looped antenna the station had detected, which meant that every reading came with an opposite possible \u201creciprocal\u201d bearing. A bearing of due east sometimes really meant due west; it was up to the navigator to discern which was most likely correct. To many seasoned Navy officers, RDF seemed almost foolish. What navigator worth his salt would trust dubious readings from a lighthouse jockey and a loop of wire over his own calculations? Hunter, who\u2019d once famously made his way into an Alaskan port through a blinding fog, usually had little use for RDF. But three hours was a long time to go without seeing anything, so at 2:15 p.m. Hunter had his crew contact the only RDF-equipped station along the route\u2014the lighthouse at Point Arguello, at the edge of the rugged coast that jutted out 80 miles northwest of Santa Barbara. A radioman at the lighthouse sent back a compass reading: 167 degrees. This suggested that the ship had already passed Point Arguello, which was obviously wrong; they hadn\u2019t been on the water nearly long enough. Hunter asked for a repeat bearing and got a similar reading. Meanwhile, the crew still weren\u2019t able to see anything on the shore to confirm their position. When Blodgett, Hunter\u2019s second-in-command, suggested moving closer to the coast to improve visibility, Hunter said no\u2014that would force them to slow down and scuttle the squadron\u2019s speed exercise. Instead, Hunter questioned the lighthouse radioman, radioing back that they were north of Point Arguello. The radioman supplied the reciprocal reading. That seemed to produce reasonable verification that they were where they thought they were. For consequential calls like this one, Hunter turned to Watson, his commander, for approval. For much of the day, Watson had stayed off the bridge; by at least one account, he\u2019d spent that time in his quarters, in conversation with Dooman, stepping out every hour or so to sign off on Hunter\u2019s decisions. Watson agreed with his captain that they were where dead reckoning placed them\u2014that the RDF had to be wrong. They continued on, the Delphy in front, 13 destroyers following. But their location on the route was hardly a trivial concern. Point Arguello marked the spot where Watson\u2019s ships needed to turn left into the Santa Barbara Channel. If they turned too soon, they risked running headlong into Honda Point. Everyone on the ships knew about Honda Point\u2014a hook of land jutting out from the coast a few miles north of the entrance of the Santa Barbara Channel. The shore along Honda Point is made up of sharp igneous rock and steep bluffs with few beaches. The waves are relentless, and boulders and reefs lurk below the waterline like booby traps. Its original name, Point Pedernales, was from the Spanish como un pedernal, or \u201clike flint.\u201d Some referred to it as the Devil\u2019s Jaw. Then, as if to demonstrate the hazards ahead of them, news came of a crisis in the channel. Another vessel\u2014not a Navy ship, but a steamer called the Cuba\u2014had run aground that morning in the fog along the rocky shore of San Miguel Island, at the channel\u2019s southern boundary. The Cuba had been full of passengers; a hundred people were floating in lifeboats or had already made it to shore. One of Watson\u2019s division commanders, Walter G. Roper, aboard the destroyer Kennedy, asked to join the relief efforts. Watson refused. The squadron had its orders, and another ship had already been sent to the Cuba\u2019s aid. Watson thought it best to stay out of the way of the rescue operation, along with the rocks where the Cuba ran aground. He and Roper argued about it over the squadron\u2019s party line\u2014which meant that other crew members on Roper\u2019s ship heard the exchange\u2014and finally Roper relented. For generations, the Navy had allowed its commanders extraordinary leeway in decision-making. It was standard procedure not to second-guess the man in charge. This was the ethos Watson grew up with, his father\u2019s credo. He believed that his squadron needed him to lead, especially as the weather got worse\u2014fog, rain, buckling waves, and the coast nowhere in sight. One of Watson\u2019s ships, the John Francis Burnes, had dropped out of the exercise with a boiler problem. That was unfortunate, but for Hunter and Watson it was no reason for the rest of the squadron to slow down. At 4:27 p.m., with the fog even thicker, Watson ordered the remaining destroyers to assume a column formation, each boat following the one in front by sight, with just a few dozen yards between them. At 5 p.m. the sun came out briefly, but Hunter still couldn\u2019t make out the horizon through the haze. Watson\u2019s column of ships continued on for three more hours, unable to tell exactly where they were, yet confident they were far enough south of Honda Point. The clock was ticking: To wait any longer would risk the ship hitting the far side of the channel. At 8:35 p.m., the Delphy received another compass reading from the Point Arguello lighthouse. This time it placed them well north of the channel entrance. Watson, summoned to the bridge after dining with Dooman, couldn\u2019t believe it. How could they have traveled all day and still be so far from the channel? The more Watson thought it over, the less he trusted RDF. They were again faced with a choice: trust the new technology, or trust dead reckoning. And once again, they had a solution available to them that made sense of the confusing information they\u2019d received: the reciprocal compass reading. When they flipped the RDF compass point, yet again the Delphy was where dead reckoning placed it. Problem solved, it seemed. The Delphy\u2019s navigator, Blodgett, knew that there was another tool they could use to make sure the ship had reached the channel: a fathometer, which measures depth. A shallow reading would mean the Delphy was too close to the coast to safely turn. Blodgett wanted to do a depth sounding. Hunter said it wasn\u2019t necessary. And of course, to do a sounding they\u2019d have to slow down. Watson affirmed Hunter\u2019s conclusion. He agreed that they had passed Point Arguello. This meant that the clock was ticking: To wait any longer would risk the ship hitting the far side of the channel, repeating the Cuba\u2019s mistake. And so at 8:45 p.m., the Delphy laid plans for a 55-degree course change to port\u2014a left turn, straight into the channel. Watson returned to his quarters. From the bridge, Hunter could see the lights of ten or more ships behind him in the dark. Maybe visibility wasn\u2019t so bad after all? But then, just after the turn, the Delphy plunged once again into a thick fog bank. The men on board couldn\u2019t see a thing. Two boats behind the Delphy on the Young, William Calhoun still couldn\u2019t make out the lights from Point Arguello. Perhaps the fog was too thick, or the Young too far from shore? But he did see the lights of the Delphy and the S.P. Lee, just ahead, and some of the other ships behind. So he continued to follow the leader. Then came a jolt to the ship\u2014not so much heard as felt, a slight trembling in the hull. At once, Calhoun thought they\u2019d been rammed, but by what? He rushed to the bridge just in time for a second jolt. There was nothing slight about this one. The Young\u2019s navigator had lurched out of the formation\u2014technically the correct reaction for a ship running aground\u2014only to slam into something harder. Right away the Young started to list, its engine room filling with water through a gash in the hull. It took just seconds for the entire destroyer to lean about 30 degrees. Then the power went out. Between the darkness and the fog, no one could see a thing. By the time Calhoun ordered his executive officer, Lieutenant Eugene Herzinger, to pass the word to stand by to abandon ship, the ship was listing nearly 45 degrees. This meant that the lifeboats were no longer an option\u2014they were completely submerged. Calhoun was left with one narrow hope: that the Young could somehow settle against whatever it was they\u2019d rammed into and avoid sinking entirely. He crawled up to the ship\u2019s port side, which had now risen out of the water. The hull was coated in oil, and so slick that the crew that made it up there before him now had nothing to hang on to. Some had fallen into the water, and there seemed to be no way of helping them. To follow them in would doom them all. And so Calhoun retracted his own order to stand by to abandon ship and told everyone around him to spread the word to gather on the port side, and above all not to jump into the water. \u201cDon\u2019t leave her\u2014she is on the rocks!\u201d Calhoun cried. \u201cShe can\u2019t sink. Stick and you\u2019ll be saved!\u201d On the Delphy, Dooman was with Watson in the captain\u2019s quarters when a noise came from beneath the ship. That scrape of metal against rock was unmistakable. Even he, a civilian, knew that they had hit bottom. Then came the crash. The ship lurched, sending both Dooman and Watson toppling and shattering the glass of the portholes. Dooman was thrown against the window at his back. Drawers jumped out of cabinets, papers flew, everything not nailed down was suddenly somewhere else. Without a word Watson dashed to the bridge, leaving Dooman alone. The bridge was in chaos. As far as Watson and Hunter were concerned, there was only one possibility: They\u2019d gone too far ahead, hitting the same spot that claimed the Cuba, San Miguel Island. They\u2019d soon learn how wrong they were. But in that moment, Watson ordered two radio messages to the other ships: \u201ckeep clear to the westward\u201d and \u201cnine turn\u201d\u2014turn to port, where he thought the others could still get to the channel. The collision with the rocks had sent the bow of the Delphy high into the air. Waves swung the ship around so that it was now astride the beach, braced against a series of rock outcroppings. Each new surge sent the vessel into spasms, quickly rupturing the hull. Down-the-line ships had followed the Delphy\u2019s lead. The S.P. Lee swung around to the side of the shore and halted. The Young was next, lurching sideways and sinking; it smashed into the shore just moments before the Delphy and was almost gone. Watson could only guess what was in store for the other ships\u2014maybe the rocky shore would claim them all. There was a more immediate concern, however. The waves slamming the Delphy repeatedly into the rocks had caused the fuel tanks to rupture. Hunter knew that the oil burners were still operational, making a boiler explosion all but imminent. He shut the master fuel valve from the bridge and ordered all crew in the engine room and the steaming fire rooms to lift the safety valves before coming up. By then the ship was pounding the rocks so violently that Hunter knew it was only a matter of time before it broke up and sank. That was when Hunter asked Watson for permission to give the abandon ship order. Watson was quick to agree. But abandon for what? Oil from the Delphy was gushing into the surrounding water. The sea was a thick stew, with a five-inch slick on the surface, making swimming near impossible. The men on the top deck with Hunter were desperate to get off the ship. Back in Watson\u2019s quarters, Dooman could hear the ship\u2019s siren. He ran out on deck in time to see the Delphy\u2019s searchlight beaming the water. He saw another ship crash, then another. He heard sirens and saw searchlights from those, too\u2014ship after ship\u2014and knew there had to be more behind them. With men rushing everywhere and sirens wailing, a thought gripped Dooman: the silver. He stopped an officer, who told him that the lower part of the Delphy had flooded; this included the guest cabin where Dooman was staying. In any case, the silver was too heavy to carry if he needed to swim to safety. Dooman hurried back to Watson\u2019s cabin. He sat down and waited, unsure of what to do next, or if he\u2019d been forgotten completely. The men on the top deck with Hunter were desperate to get off the ship. Some of the crew had braved the sludgy water and made it to an outcropping about 15 feet from shore; others became mired in the water, only to be pulled back onto the Delphy. Blodgett worked to set up a rope the men could use as a guide to the outcropping. Not everyone made it: Fireman Third Class James W. H. Conway and Cabin Cook Sofronio Dalida both died in the water. Worst of all was the slow-motion tragedy of Fireman J. T. Pearson, who leapt overboard to help save three men in the water, shattered his glasses, and was blinded by the shards. Pearson cried for help and was pulled back aboard the Delphy. He was hysterical with pain and panic, and had taken in so much seawater and fuel that he fell to the deck. Blodgett held a flashlight as a pharmacist\u2019s mate worked to remove the glass from Pearson\u2019s eyes, to no avail. The ship was slick with oil, and equipment was flying everywhere, making it impossible to get Pearson onto a raft without endangering more lives. Left with no other choice, Blodgett ordered a radioman to lash Pearson to the Delphy\u2019s searchlight tower\u2014what appeared to be a safe place amidships, forward of where the waves were breaking over the hull. They used a signal line that was tight enough to secure him, but not so tight that he couldn\u2019t free himself if he regained his faculties. The plan was to come back and evacuate him; that never happened. The waves raged into the night as, from the shore, the men of the Delphy could hear his repeated screams. Calhoun didn\u2019t know how long he had before the Young would sink. The ship had tilted fully onto its side in practically no time at all; Calhoun later put it at just 90 seconds from the moment they ran aground. Now his ship was sliced open on the starboard side, with just two feet of the port side still above the surface of the water. With the port side now the Young\u2019s deck, some 80 men gripped the smashed portholes of the ship\u2019s hull. Many were barefoot and wore what they\u2019d gone to sleep in; some were tied to one another with lines. They waited for rescue as the waves crashed against the ship. Calhoun knew that he hadn\u2019t time for his men to put on life preservers and file into lifeboats: Like Hunter on the Delphy, he was aware that the active burners could explode the boiler, igniting the oil in the water around them. He asked for a volunteer to extinguish the burners. Fireman I.T. Scott came forward, then rushed below. Minutes passed and Scott didn\u2019t return. Had he cut the boiler? Did he escape the ship? Calhoun had no way to know for sure. Calhoun\u2019s executive officer, Gene Herzinger, and Chief Boatswain\u2019s Mate Arthur Peterson climbed up and out from a bridge window. Peterson found an axe and smashed the portholes, providing the crew with handholds as the sea inundated the deck. They were 100 yards from shore, too far to risk swimming amid the oily waves and jagged rocks. Or was it? Peterson wanted to try. He grabbed a life preserver and some rope and volunteered to swim for a large rock nearby. If he could reach that spot with the line, the other men could use it to get there, too, and they\u2019d be that much closer to shore. They were working through a plan when the Chauncey came into view. Calhoun nearly panicked. All it would take was one strong wake to shove the Young off its perch on the rock. The Chauncey got close enough to hear the Young\u2019s crew\u2014Calhoun loudest of them all\u2014shouting not to collide with their sinking ship. The ship slammed into the tiny craft, threatening to crash on top of them. The Delphy\u2019s lights went out. Alone in Watson\u2019s quarters, Dooman couldn\u2019t see a thing. He\u2019d have no choice but to abandon the valise. Dooman returned to the deck, frightened but also appalled to have been forgotten. The ship was low in the sea, and water swamped the deck. Dooman saw some of the crew at the stern, which appeared to be angled higher than the rest of the ship. Higher seemed safer, so he made his way in that direction, pulling himself along by the torpedo rails as waves smashed the deck. When Dooman arrived at the back of the Delphy, he saw that the men had run a line between the ship and a large rock 40 feet from shore. He also saw how dangerous it was\u2014some who\u2019d attempted the crossing had been flung into the water\u2014and he was afraid to risk his life. Dooman decided to run back to the front of the ship, until an officer shined a flashlight in his face. \u201cYou\u2019re the passenger,\u201d the officer said. It seemed that Dooman hadn\u2019t been forgotten after all. He asked the man for help, and with the help of another sailor they found a raft stored on deck. They threw it over the side and jumped in, only to realize that it remained lashed to the Delphy. They were stuck. The ship slammed into the tiny craft, threatening to crash on top of them. Dooman had a small penknife attached to his watch chain. He handed it to the sailor, who hacked through the line. With some effort, the raft made it over the waves to the rock. From there they were able to walk to land when the tide receded. One by one, Dooman and the others reached safety. Watson finally made it across the line at 11 p.m. With one exception\u2014Lieutenant Pearson, blinded and lashed to the rigging of a capsized, disintegrating vessel\u2014the captain was the last to leave his ship. The Chauncey threw all its power into reverse, but it was stuck with competing mandates\u2014to avoid a collision with the Young, and to avoid the cliffs of Honda Point. In the end it hit the Young: The undertow hurled the Chauncey\u2019s stern up against the destroyer\u2019s port propeller blades, which ripped into the Chauncey\u2019s starboard hull. Water gushed into the engine room, the ship lost power, and, in a final insult, a wave slammed the Chauncey onto a reef. Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Booth sent down an order to stand by to abandon ship and, like Hunter and Calhoun before him, began weighing strategies to get his crew to shore alive. Perversely, the collision was good news for the Young. Once the Chauncey was firmly stuck on the same reef, it shielded Calhoun\u2019s ship from some of the most turbulent waves. Better still, the Chauncey was fairly close to shore\u2014about 25 yards\u2014and was no longer at risk of sinking. Now all the crew of the Young needed to do was get to the Chauncey, which was about 75 yards away. Members of the Chauncey\u2019s crew succeeded in dragging a pair of lines ashore and setting up as many rafts to ferry the men through the oily waves. Once ashore, the survivors climbed a steep cliff to reach the mainland. A radioman on the Chauncey named Frederick Fish later remembered finding an unconscious crew member of the Young in the water and bringing him to land. Men from the Delphy were there as well, Fish recalled\u2014\u201cwalking about in a dreamlike daze, stumbling and falling, cutting their hands and bare feet on the jagged edges of the cliff.\u201d Looking out at the water, Fish could see the Delphy smashed against a rock and observed its crew shuttle as many men to shore as possible. Before long, Fish heard \u201cthe cries for help of an injured man who was lashed there.\u201d That was Pearson. Blodgett from the Delphy was on shore, and he told Fish what had happened\u2014how Pearson was blinded and strapped to the hull of the Delphy. \u201cHis calls kept up through the night, and they still ring in my brain,\u201d Fish recalled. \u201cTo hear a fellow creature calling for help and not be able to relieve him is the crudest torture possible to man.\u201d \u201cHad he lost his hold,\u201d Calhoun recalled, \u201che would have been in fuel oil and an angry sea, and would undoubtedly have lost his life.\u201d On the Young, holding fast to its sinking hull, all the remaining men could do was look on as the crew of the Chauncey worked to save themselves before setting up a line for the other ship. Finally, someone decided not to wait any longer. Peterson, the chief boatswain\u2019s mate, had planned to swim for the rock between the Young and the shore before the Chauncey arrived. Now he was ready to swim to the Chauncey. Peterson took three lengths of line totaling more than 100 yards, found a doughnut-shaped buoy, fastened the line to it, and slipped the buoy over his head. On Calhoun\u2019s order, he dove into the frigid water and made it to the Chauncey in a matter of minutes. A crew member recalled hearing Calhoun shout that a swimmer was coming their way. Once Peterson had been lifted aboard the Chauncey, Herzinger followed using Peterson\u2019s line. \u201cHad he lost his hold,\u201d Calhoun recalled, \u201che would have been in fuel oil and an angry sea, and would undoubtedly have lost his life.\u201d After Herzinger made it across, the Chauncey sent back a seven-man raft. Evacuations commenced\u2014four men on the first raft, eight on the second, ten on the others. It took 11 crossings to get everyone who could be found off the Young. Calhoun made one last inspection before boarding the final raft. \u201cI want to state that Providence put the Chauncey ashore in that place,\u201d Calhoun later said. \u201cIt is absolutely certain in my mind that the loss of the Chauncey saved half of the crew of my ship or more.\u201d There was one additional consolation: Fireman Scott, who had volunteered to shut down the Young\u2019s boiler, finally reappeared at about 10:30 p.m., when the lighthouse keepers on shore heard cries for help from the bottom of the bluffs\u2014five surviving sailors, including Scott. He\u2019d made it off the Young and into the water but was unconscious, and when he awoke he clung to a piece of flotsam; he\u2019d floated for an hour before being hauled aboard a raft. Calhoun knew that not everyone from his ship had made it. He wondered how many still flailed in the oil-coated water. And the engine- and fire-room crews deep inside the ship: had they been trapped down below, or were they pulled out by the undertow as the ship rolled? Those men\u2014his men\u2014had been 150 yards from shore with no way out of the ship. On shore, when Herzinger mentioned to Calhoun that the losses were great, as many as 20 or 30 sailors, the young captain\u2019s response was grave: \u201cMy God, I know\u2014but we will not discuss it now.\u201d The rescue efforts were just getting underway as the remaining ships neared Honda Point, still following the leader. For some it was too late to change course. One after another, they smashed into the shore\u2014a seven-ship pileup on the California coast\u2014hitting rocks, reefs, and, in some cases, one another. The officers of the Woodbury saw lights ahead of the other ships and assumed a man was overboard. They reversed engines, but not soon enough to avoid ramming a large boulder. The Nicholas struck a reef, and the pounding surf spun the boat until it pointed out to sea. The oil, the rocks, and the darkness made lowering rafts impossible; the men had to wait all night for a lifeline from shore. Then came the Farragut, named for the great Civil War hero. Lieutenant Commander J. F. McClain ordered a full stop, but reversing the engines doused the ship\u2019s lights. Suddenly, it was dark again, and the Fuller, next in the squadron line, collided with the Farragut before hitting a pinnacle rock\u2014the same one that had claimed the Woodbury. The ships at the back of Watson\u2019s column, the Percival and the Somers, had time and space enough to change course. The last division\u2014the Paul Hamilton, the Stoddert, and the Thompson\u2014never took the turn into the channel. Along the shore, an entire community was mobilizing to help rescue the sailors still in the water. The ships\u2019 sirens had woken nearby residents, who loaded their cars with blankets, hot coffee, and food, and rushed to the steep bluff. A fishing captain, Giacomo Noceti, bravely ferried his boat to the edge of the rocks and retrieved some 150 men with lines. A nearby rail station became a headquarters for relief workers, who brought aid in and shipped rescued sailors out. A passing train took the injured to Santa Barbara hospitals, and later that day another transported 38 officers and 517 enlisted men to the naval base in San Diego. The Delphy snapped in two just five minutes after everyone except Pearson had evacuated. The ship\u2019s searchlight tower leaned farther over with each barrage of waves, until it dragged the rest of the ship over and down. The section of the deck where Pearson had been tied up was pulled into the ocean. He was one of the Delphy\u2019s three casualties that night. How many were lost from the rest of the fleet wouldn\u2019t be known for hours. Through it all, Watson checked on the injured, organized search parties, tallied his men, and reported back to naval headquarters. By morning, he was preparing to send salvage parties back to the ships and arranging for the care of survivors. Even Calhoun, grappling with unspeakable losses, would later praise the commander, stating, \u201cI only hope that if ever I am faced with the tragedy that faced him that night, I\u2019ll be half the man that he was: cool, calm, courageous, and thoughtful; never missing an opportunity to aid.\u201d But in idle moments, alone with his thoughts, Watson seemed to Dooman years older. When a search party returned with the body of Fireman Conway, who had fallen from a rescue line into the water, Watson approached the stretcher. He raised the blanket and looked down on Conway for a long moment. Then, silently, the captain unbuckled the sword he wore and laid it beside the body. Was he thinking about all the men\u2014some 300 or so, as he estimated early on\u2014who might be dead because of the decision he\u2019d signed off on? Was he thinking about his friend Dooman, there only because of his invitation? Or his daughter, who\u2019d been promised a spot, and how lucky it was she hadn\u2019t been aboard? Was he thinking about his wider family? His father and the legacy of the Watsons, that night on the Hartford in 1864 and Captain Farragut\u2019s cry of \u201cDamn the torpedoes!\u201d? Did he sense any connection between that historic moment and his decision to push forward at all costs? There would be time for him to mull these questions\u2014to sift through everything that had happened\u2014later on that night, in the weeks and months to come, and for the rest of his life. 3. In the space of just ten minutes, the Navy lost more ships than it had during all of World War I. Seven destroyers ran aground, one after another, each with more than 100 men aboard. Some of them split in two on the rocks. They collided with one another. They hemorrhaged oil\u2014some 300,000 gallons covering 800 acres. Twenty-three sailors lost their lives: three on the Delphy, twenty on the Young. A miracle by some measures, a debacle by others. Of the men trapped inside the Young, most probably fought through smoke and gas, darkness and freezing water. None made it to shore. Those who didn\u2019t drown immediately were caught in the ebbing tide and sucked out to sea. The disaster was front-page news around the country. Some 10,000 people turned up for a memorial service in San Diego. A week later, hundreds of visitors from Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, and other nearby towns flocked to the cliffs above Honda Point to view the wreckage. Demand to visit the scene was so high that a special train was provided on Sunday. Many packed a lunch and remained on the bluffs all day. The day after the disaster, Navy secretary Edwin Denby seized on the great Kanto earthquake as the explanation. It was because of the quake, he suggested\u2014an act of God, with unthinkable ramifications an ocean away\u2014that nothing went as planned on the water that day. It explained why the ships never really reached 20 knots. Usually, the current pushed ships south; on that day it pushed them north. \u201cOne of the destroyers was broken in two, and it seems as if she was carried bodily up and dropped,\u201d Denby marveled. Others blamed technology: that infuriating RDF, sending good sailors astray, undermining their expertise. \u201cThe theory was advanced by mariners,\u201d The Washington Post reported, \u201cthat the compass bearings taken from a nearby shore station as guidance through the fog, had been transmitted erroneously.\u201d Yet to some the weather and the obscure compass readings only explained so much. The Navy scheduled an inquiry for Monday, September 17. Depending on the outcome, the next step could involve court-martials. That left a week for the press to point fingers. \u201cThere has been a peculiar reluctance on the part of officers responsible for full and prompt reports of what happened,\u201d a New York Times editorial declared. \u201cFor the honor of the United States Navy and for the good of the service those who were responsible should be made to suffer for it.\u201d Among those who might bear responsibility, Watson was an ideal target. Not only had he been the one in charge, but he offered a newspaper-ready narrative: an admiral\u2019s son, wealthy and connected, now facing utter disgrace. Watson and the ship commanders hunkered in San Diego, awaiting the inquiry in silence. Those close to Watson encouraged him to try and stop what was coming. His brother Loyall urged him to stand firm and defend himself. His brother-in-law, Clifford Gratz, wanted to leverage his family\u2019s relationship with the Rockefellers to spare Watson and help stave off any embarrassment to the family. Naval Academy friends worked back channels, pleading for leniency. But there was one person whose opinion mattered more than any other. On September 16, retired rear admiral John Crittenden Watson, then 80 and in fragile health, wrote to his son from his home in Washington, D.C. \u201cI knew the saving of all the lives possible would be the greatest comfort to you and our dear Hermine,\u201d the elder Watson wrote. \u201cLike both of you, our thought is that you were able to save not only your own life but to assist others.\u201d With its measured tone, the admiral\u2019s letter spoke volumes. There was no assurance of his son\u2019s guiltlessness\u2014no proclamation that, faced with the day\u2019s beguiling circumstances, he would have acted the same. The message was clear: A man\u2019s fate mattered less than his reputation. The family\u2019s honor rested with Watson now. This was a search for scapegoats\u2014but should the ships\u2019 commanders have expected anything different? Typically, Navy inquiries are confidential, as with a grand jury in a criminal case. But the press demanded that they be allowed to watch, and Denby relented. As the inquiry got underway, its public nature seemed more than anything to dictate what would become of Watson and his commanders. No one wished to give any impression that mercy would be shown to the men behind the worst peacetime disaster in Navy history. Watson and his commanders wouldn\u2019t be allowed to testify; as they were possible defendants in court-martial proceedings, anything they said could expose them to prosecution. Only one senior crew member of the Delphy was called to testify: Laurence Blodgett, Hunter\u2019s second-in-command. \u201cWe were satisfied that the Arguello radio station was wrong,\u201d Blodgett explained from the stand. \u201cThey kept giving our position north and to the west of Point Arguello, and when we could not make this check with our figures, we finally took the reciprocal of their bearings, which would show us already in the Santa Barbara Channel.\u201d As soon as he finished, the prosecutor asked to add Blodgett to the defendant list too. His role in making navigation decisions transformed him, in the eyes of the court, from a bystander to a suspect. Off the stand he went; the defense never had a chance to cross-examine him. This was a search for scapegoats\u2014but should the ships\u2019 commanders have expected anything different? Watson at least was desperate to have his say. Just days after the worst possible thing that could have happened on his watch came to pass, he was staring down what he considered another disaster. The men under his command\u2014the ones who\u2019d followed his lead\u2014were about to lose their reputations and livelihoods. This could be why, on the inquiry\u2019s second day, Watson made his first public comments about Honda Point. \u201cThe responsibility for the course of the destroyer squadron was mine, a responsibility which I fully realized,\u201d he told a reporter for a news service, whose story would appear in papers around the country in the days to come. \u201cBut that decision was based upon 33 years of experience in the Navy, and made after due consideration of reports of our position from the Point Arguello radio station, which were confusing.\u201d It was part mea culpa, part dogged display. Watson continued on like this, switching from accepting blame to explaining why, given the weather and the cryptic RDF readings, anyone in his position would have done the same thing. \u201cThe condition of visibility, remember, was such that we were unable to get our true position from the stars. We were compelled to rely upon the radio station. I asked for our bearings repeatedly. From about 6:30 until 8 o\u2019clock p.m., that most vital period in our lives, we were unable to get radio bearings from the station. I accept that responsibility. I made a naval officer\u2019s decision. I was content the radio station was wrong. And that is why I gave the order.\u201d On September 22, Watson issued a similar statement to the court of inquiry and to the press: \u201cThe Squadron Commander hopes the responsibility for this disaster, which he considers entirely his own, may not descend upon the able and loyal subordinates who supported him on all occasions.\u201d Watson was sacrificing himself, throwing himself into the prosecution\u2019s line of fire. He also asked the court to waive its rule barring potential defendants from testifying\u2014in effect, making himself more vulnerable to court-martial so that he could have his say now. The court granted Watson\u2019s request, and he was permitted to take the stand on September 24. \u201cThe responsibility was mine,\u201d he said. \u201cI was convinced that the station was wrong. But they were right.\u201d The court of inquiry\u2019s president, Rear Admiral William V. Pratt, attempted to pick apart this blanket admission. \u201cDo you feel,\u201d he asked Watson, \u201cthat you can assume all of the responsibility that at times must fall on the shoulders of your division commanders?\u201d \u201cI have no desire to assume their responsibilities,\u201d Watson replied. \u201cI simply want to make clear that I assume all of my own.\u201d Edward Howe Watson Watson braced himself for a public flogging. So perhaps he was as surprised as anyone when the opposite occurred. Almost overnight, the squadron commander transformed\u2014in the eyes of the public, at least\u2014from the incompetent scion of a naval legend to a paragon of selflessness and sacrifice. More than one newspaper editorial used the word \u201cmanliness\u201d to describe what he\u2019d done. \u201cCapt. Watson has given a splendid example of the finest attributes of character overcoming the elemental instinct of self-preservation,\u201d the Army and Navy Journal declared, while the San Diego Sun waxed on about Watson\u2019s \u201cheroic\u201d soul. \u201cHe waits for no court martial. He relies not on lawyers. He seeks no avenue of evasion. He resorts to no subterfuge. Lest the blame rest on some innocent man, he takes upon himself full responsibility for his actions.\u201d Others around the country joined the chorus, taking Watson\u2019s testimony as their cue to examine what true leadership really meant. \u201cThe heroism of captain Watson is of a different type,\u201d declared the Santa Monica Evening Gazette. \u201cIt manifests itself after deliberation; after the weighing of consequences.\u201d And this from the San Francisco Chronicle: \u201cFrom the moment the ship struck, his bearing and speech have been that of a most remarkable example of real manliness under the most distressing conditions which an officer in his position can ever meet.\u201d The goodwill seemed to play a part in Watson persuading the other officers named as defendants to join him in testifying, so that they also would have the chance to recount what had happened that night. This was no small thing: By opening themselves to prosecution, these officers had to have faith that Watson\u2019s contrition would reflect well on them. Admiral Pratt called their decision to testify \u201cworthy of the best traditions of the Navy.\u201d When the Delphy\u2019s skipper, Hunter, testified, he also made sure to blame the technology, as Watson had. \u201cI\u2019ll have to admit that it was an error in judgment,\u201d he testified. \u201cBut as contributing causes I believe \u2026 the fact that a bilateral radio compass is used there were partly responsible.\u201d Hunter also floated the \u201cpossibility\u201d that \u201cabnormal currents caused by the Japanese earthquake\u201d contributed to the problem. In response, the lieutenant commander in charge of the Point Arguello lighthouse took the stand, defending his compass bearings that night. In fact, the readings had been within a few degrees of accuracy the whole time, even if one of them had required a reciprocal adjustment. Many of Watson\u2019s other commanders said that they weren\u2019t responsible for what had happened because they\u2019d been duty-bound to follow the Delphy\u2019s lead. The Navy\u2019s sacred adherence to chain of command suddenly was on trial, too. Robert Morris, the commander of the division of ships immediately astern of the Delphy, said that they \u201ccould not possibly be held culpable in carrying out the destroyer doctrine of following their leader.\u201d Rear Admiral Pratt asked Morris, \u201cDoes seniority take the place of common sense?\u201d Morris replied, \u201cThey are supposed to be synonymous.\u201d Not every skipper had hewed so tightly to that edict. Thomas A. Symington of the Thompson, the last ship in line, said that once he\u2019d noticed the confusion of lights and sirens ahead, he slowed down to take soundings. Leslie Bratton of the Stoddert said that he\u2019d opted to violate the no-navigation order and asked the lighthouse for radio bearings himself, then steered his ship away in time to avoid disaster. Hardy B. Page, navigator of the Hamilton, said that he\u2019d suspected there was a problem ahead and advised his commanding officer to get word to the division commander\u2014a decision that helped the division\u2019s three ships escape intact. Finally, the board heard from Walter Roper\u2014the division commander who a few hours before the disaster had jousted with Watson by radio about helping the Cuba. Roper was as flinty on the stand as he\u2019d been that night on the water. \u201cI\u2019m not a desk man. My experience comes from hard knocks,\u201d he said, a jab at Watson\u2019s lack of experience and Hunter\u2019s academy training. \u201cThere are too many book-learned and not enough practical men running the Navy.\u201d In Roper\u2019s view, those on the Delphy should never have assumed that the ship really was going 20 knots in such choppy water. The error, he said, was in putting \u201ctoo much reliance on computation of speed by propeller revolutions.\u201d In his experience, he said, he\u2019d seen propellers indicate 20 knots when the ship was in fact going only 12. Roper made a point of saying that he would have heeded the lighthouse. \u201cI have gone into the most dangerous harbors in the world through impenetrable fogs, guided almost wholly by radio compass,\u201d he said. His division had never turned left, he testified, because he never came close to trusting the Delphy. \u201cI was positive we had not passed Point Arguello. I did not know the forward ships were turning. Could I have seen them, I would not have followed, but instead would have tried to stop them. My motto is \u2018Never try to turn a corner until you have passed.\u2019 \u201d Rear Admiral Pratt asked Roper if he would have turned left had he been on the ship behind the Delphy. \u201cOf course I would not,\u201d Roper said. \u201c \u2018Follow the leader\u2019 is all right, but it should be tempered with common sense. When I was a boy, our leader once jumped off a barn. I stayed put\u2014and walked down to pick him up. He had a broken leg.\u201d The room erupted with laughter. But the fact remained that Roper failed to speak up against Watson at the time. Had he been stinging from their quarrel over the Cuba? If he\u2019d said something\u2014one of many ifs that night\u2014might the entire disaster have been avoided, and 23 lives spared? \u201cI am ready and anxious to take my medicine,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want an acquittal.\u201d On October 12, the court of inquiry made its determination. Never mind the weather and the radio; the Honda Point disaster, the court ruled, was the result of \u201cbad errors and faulty navigation.\u201d Faced with so much uncertainty, the ships should have slowed down to take depth soundings. Following the leader may have been a Navy tradition, but it shouldn\u2019t trump reason. Eleven officers were recommended for court-martial. Watson, Hunter, and Blodgett were charged with \u201cculpable inefficiency and negligence,\u201d and eight others with simple negligence. But the court seemed gripped by contradictory impulses. It issued a letter to Calhoun, the Young\u2019s commander, commending him \u201cfor coolness, intelligence, and seamanlike ability,\u201d and to Walter D. Seed, of the Fuller, for \u201cgreat bravery in swimming \u2026 about seventy five yards, through a rough and turbulent sea \u2026 for the salvage of the crew.\u201d Yet both also faced charges of negligence. The court-martial proceedings took place in rapid succession during the month of November. All eyes remained on Watson. Would his penitence spare the others? On November 7, Watson doubled down with another public statement. \u201cI am ready and anxious to take my medicine. I don\u2019t want an acquittal. For me to be acquitted by this court would be bad for the naval service, to which both my father and myself have devoted our lives.\u201d Calhoun, at his trial, went out of his way to commend Watson. He testified that in his opinion no power on earth could have saved the Young and the other ships after the Delphy ran aground. Calhoun insisted that he had no reason to suspect the Delphy of any errors, and testified that he and the Young\u2019s crew would not have done anything differently had they been at the front of the line\u2014except perhaps take soundings. Watson reciprocated as a witness at Calhoun\u2019s trial. \u201cEvery man of the crew of the Young owes his life solely and entirely to Commander Calhoun,\u201d he testified. In his summation speech in Watson\u2019s trial, Watson\u2019s lawyer, Thomas T. Craven, noted how, at Honda Point, \u201cfate was indeed stern upon this occasion.\u201d If the Delphy had continued south for just a few more minutes before turning, the entire column of ships would have cleared the rocks. If they\u2019d turned a few minutes sooner, the coast would have been more forgiving, resulting in less damage and fewer lives lost. How many Navy men, Craven asked, had made similarly small missteps and escaped the hand of fate? Watson, he suggested, was a victim of bad luck. Calhoun was acquitted after 40 minutes of deliberation. Blodgett, the Delphy\u2019s navigator, was also acquitted, as were seven other defendants. There were just two convictions: Edward Howe Watson and Donald T. Hunter would not escape official blame for what happened that night. But considering the scale of the catastrophe, their sentences were lighter than expected. Both Watson and Hunter were allowed to continue their military careers, but with lower ranking numbers, which virtually eliminated the possibility of promotion. Neither would command a ship again, but they would retain their ranks. And the careers of the other men would be saved. \u201cIt is a very proper sentence,\u201d Watson told reporters. \u201cIt is a fitting punishment. The loss of a few numbers could not be a sufficient punishment for an error as great as mine was. I am glad that the sentence is as severe as it is. It puts me very near the bottom of the list of captains, I guess. Needless to say, it does not make me happy.\u201d Watson had transformed from a villain to a hero with his admission in September. Now, in December, with his career intact, things changed again. Back Watson went, from hero to goat. Yet, by taking the blame, had Watson\u2014no matter how gallant the gesture\u2014simply given the Navy a smooth path toward putting the embarrassing episode behind it? And was the Navy now rewarding Watson for his contrition? After the loss of seven ships and 23 lives, how was it exactly that not one member of the Navy had lost their job? \u201cJust learned court-martial has been very lenient with everybody,\u201d President Calvin Coolidge said. Navy Secretary Denby also made sure to grumble publicly that the \u201csentence in [Watson\u2019s] case is inadequate.\u201d On December 29, the Army and Navy Journal reported, \u201cThe light sentence created almost as great a sensation at Washington as the disaster.\u201d Eugene Dooman\u2019s escape from the scene at Honda Point occurred just before dawn after the wrecks, when a train to Los Angeles approached the local station where the relief efforts were headquartered. Watson told Dooman and a few others to board it. Hundreds of other men would be taking the San Diego train a few hours later. Dooman, like many in the squadron, was covered from head to foot with oil, so a conductor placed some newspapers on the seat, and off they went. In Los Angeles, Dooman was on his own again, delivered from the tragedy\u2014and from the official narrative. The available record from the court of inquiry and Watson\u2019s court-martial includes just one mention of a civilian on the Delphy, but Dooman\u2019s name never appears. In the years to come, as military and civilian historians researched the Honda Point disaster, the idea of a not-spoken-for witness to the disaster proved tantalizing. He was called the \u201cmystery guest,\u201d the \u201ccivilian,\u201d the \u201cphantom passenger.\u201d Rumors circulated that he and Watson had been drinking that day (Watson and others denied this), or that Watson subsequently swore him to silence about what really went wrong that night. But while Dooman\u2019s identity was never well publicized, it was never really secret either. In January 1924, he gave a long interview to an English-language paper in Japan, complimenting Watson\u2019s performance on the night of the wreck and relating the tale of his own escape. Had the historians and writers seen that article, the mystery would have been solved. After 30 years as a diplomat in Tokyo, Dooman came home to America after Pearl Harbor, retiring just a few years later, in 1945. It took until the 1960s for him to be located and asked about Honda Point. \u201cI am not competent\u201d to pass judgment on Watson\u2019s decisions that day, he wrote one interlocutor in 1966. \u201cThat is to say, I cannot weigh the extenuating circumstances, but a disaster did occur and the man who made the decision had to assume responsibility.\u201d Dooman was asked why he was never called to testify in the inquiry, and what happened to the $3,000 in silver he\u2019d brought on board. The answers, it turned out, were linked. The silver was sacrificed, Dooman wrote, in the name of discretion. The money had been found in the wreckage, he wrote, \u201cbut could not be claimed without the probability of being called as a witness in the court-martial, and Watson and his defense officer were afraid that my testimony might prove harmful to Watson, since I was with him when the ship struck.\u201d By today\u2019s standards, these actions would have constituted a cover-up. But every answer Dooman gave seemed to prompt more questions. Why had the Navy not asked him to testify? Did his job in the State Department play a part in that decision? Or was the Navy afraid that additional testimony from a civilian passenger would add yet more unwelcome intrigue to a debacle it wished would just go away? Dooman wouldn\u2019t say. But he and Watson remained friends for years. A few days after the disaster, Dooman explained, with the inquiry not yet begun, he\u2019d paid a visit to Watson and his wife at their home in San Diego. (Some armchair historians, parsing the disaster\u2019s themes of negligence and culpability, have gone so far as to wonder if the captain reimbursed Dooman his lost $3,000 in return for his discretion. If such a thing occurred, Dooman never mentioned it.) The Watsons would later visit Japan, in 1937, and dine with Dooman there. He curtly alluded to the price Watson paid for the tragedy, the toll it took on him. \u201cAfter the disaster,\u201d Dooman wrote, \u201che lost his zest for living and became very despondent.\u201d Just after the court-martial, Dooman wrote a letter to Watson, one of dozens sent by friends and well-wishers hoping to soften the blow. \u201cDo you know what a splendid impression you have made on everybody,\u201d the diplomat wrote from Washington, \u201cnot only those high in the Navy but the man in the street? I dined with Admiral Knight who said splendid things about you. I think you will appreciate even more, though, what I overheard in the cars the other day\u2014\u2018Well,\u2019 said one, \u2018I don\u2019t get this stuff about the compass, but as long as we have fellows in the Navy like this guy who took the blame we shouldn\u2019t worry.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThere was nothing the fleet wanted that Uncle Bill wouldn\u2019t get,\u201d one commander would say. William Calhoun was cleared of any blame for the Young\u2019s tragedy; he was even commended for his cool demeanor during the rescue. But the loss of 20 men weighed heavily on him, and for a time it seemed foolish to assume that Calhoun would command a ship again. Eventually, however, his career righted itself. After serving on several ships, further instruction at the Naval War College, and a stint as an instructor at the Naval Academy, Calhoun returned to sea as commanding officer of the USS Rochester, and later the USS California. In 1938, he was promoted to rear admiral. The next year, he became commander of the Navy\u2019s Pacific base in Honolulu and remained in that position through World War II. \u201cThere was nothing the fleet wanted that Uncle Bill wouldn\u2019t get,\u201d one commander would say. Calhoun retired in 1946 a four-star admiral, after 44 years of active service. There was just one thing missing from his time at sea: He never saw battle. For that he\u2019d be granted some satisfaction from the author James A. Michener, who\u2019d been a lieutenant commander under Calhoun during the war. \u201cThose of us who worked for Uncle Billy believed that he had played a major role in smothering the Japanese with mat\u00e9riel,\u201d Michener wrote in his memoirs, \u201cand the fighting admirals agreed.\u201d In Michener\u2019s Tales of the South Pacific\u2014the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning basis for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\u2014Calhoun is said to be the model for Millard Kester, a grounded admiral who finally gets to do battle at sea, leading an entire invasion force. And winning. Calhoun died in 1963; he had married and was a grandfather many times over. In 1984, some 61 years after the disaster, a scuba diver and amateur treasure hunter exploring the California coast noticed something shiny on the ocean floor, churned up by a recent storm: a class ring from the Naval Academy. It didn\u2019t take long to connect the ring to its deceased owner. The diver had hoped to make some money for a discovery from the site of the disaster. One collector offered him $1,500. Then a fellow diver let him know that Calhoun\u2019s widow, Rosalie, was alive and living in Coronado, near San Diego. Her phone number was listed. He agreed to sell the ring to her for $400\u2014the cost of the dive, he said. Rosalie had never remarried. The ring, when the diver handed it over, stirred something in her. \u201cIt\u2019s like part of him was brought back,\u201d she said, filled with emotion for her lost husband. On December 14, 1923, six days after Edward Howe Watson\u2019s conviction in a Navy court-martial, his father, retired admiral John Crittenden Watson, died at 81. A fellow retired admiral, Colby M. Chester, wrote to the younger Watson that same day: \u201cYour name was the last one uttered by your father, and I know how happy the Honda affair made him.\u201d Happy that his son\u2019s career was intact, perhaps. Or that the family name had, despite everything, retained some of its dignity. On January 10, 1924, Watson along with his wife and daughter moved to Honolulu, where he was stationed until his retirement five years later. In the 1930s, the Watsons lived in New York and then in Jamestown, Rhode Island, visiting Japan several times. In the years before World War II, Watson indulged his fascination with Japan, writing poems about historic Japanese figures. That other existence he might have led before Honda Point\u2014the life of a sly and insightful Navy attach\u00e9, drawing out spies and supplying Washington with essential information about a potentially lethal foe\u2014seemed to loom large for him. In the late 1930s, Watson drafted a long policy memo about Japan to a friend at the Naval War College, still hoping someone would heed his warnings\u2014\u201cstuff that I have worked up during the past 5 years, since my retirement,\u201d as he described it. \u201cPerhaps it will help to save many hours to some fellow who is doing a bit of research work on the subject. Dispose of it as your judgment dictates. Either in the files or by burning.\u201d Watson died of heart disease in a Navy hospital on January 7, 1942, a month to the day after Pearl Harbor proved his point. His family later said that they thought the attack had hastened his death. Honda Point was not mentioned in any of his published obituaries. Watson had pursued a life of significance, of honor. At Honda Point, the son emulated the father, following the traditions of leadership codified by an entire generation\u2014and those same traditions contributed to the disaster. But after the worst happened, and the nation had judged him, he chose to preserve his character. In doing so, he acquired a different kind of significance, one he hadn\u2019t expected. In his papers, there is a letter from Watson\u2019s father written on October 1, 1923, just after Watson had publicly accepted responsibility for the error that cost the Navy seven ships and 23 lives. In its tone, the letter was far warmer and more effusive than the one that had preceded it. \u201cI cannot express in any words how proud we are of you and of your devoted wife,\u201d the father wrote. In the letter, Watson\u2019s father offered his son a gift. He said that a relative of the late Admiral David Farragut had written to him \u201cto express his confidence in you,\u201d and sent along a precious keepsake: a makeshift tourniquet the elder Watson had made aboard the Hartford during the Civil War, \u201cjust as we were about to pass up the Mississippi by the Confederate batteries.\u201d Farragut had given this rag\u2014a relic of John Crittenden\u2019s most glorious moment in the Navy\u2014to his own son \u201cto use in case of a wound.\u201d Now it seemed that someone else had a better use for it. \u201cWhen I wrote him I know you would love to have it, he sent it to me,\u201d Watson\u2019s father wrote. \u201cI will hold it for you until you come East. All of us join in ever much love to all three of you.\u201d And so Edward Howe Watson was offered a tourniquet\u2014a message from father to son. His son was wounded and needed care. His son was worthy of greatness. His son was a Watson. And in court his son had not shirked from his duty to do what the father never had to do: go down with his ship. \u00a9 2023 The Atavist Magazine. Proudly powered by Newspack by Automattic.

The evolution of diesel fuel quality is summarized in the table below. India has reduced its diesel sulfur content from 10,000 ppm in most of the country in 1999 to a maximum content of 350 ppm in 2012. During this same time period, India reduced diesel sulfur content from 2,500 ppm to 50 ppm in thirteen major metropolitan areas. Another factor that improved over this period was the cetane number, which increased from 45 to 51 nationwide over a period of 13 years. The BS VI regulation reduced diesel sulfur content to a maximum of 10 ppm, enabling the introduction of advanced emission control technologies, including diesel particulate filters (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, which are both needed to meet BS VI emission standards.

In case a value exceeding the limit is obtained on finished fuels in the market, ASTM D 4046 / ISO 13759 shall be used to establish the presence of a nitrate-containing compound. In such a case, the present limit for carbon residue cannot be applied. However, the use of ignition improver does not exempt the manufacturer from meeting this requirement prior to the addition of additives. b For diesel process from Assam crude, either CN of 45 min or Cl of 43 min and density of 820\u2013870 shall be applicable. Non-road diesel India currently does not have separate standards for commercial non-road diesel. Because most diesel for non-road vehicles and equipment is obtained from on-road vehicle fuel stations, consumers in the thirteen Bharat IV cities presumably use 50 ppm sulfur diesel to fuel construction equipment, and those in Bharat III areas likely use 350 ppm sulfur diesel. Agricultural tractors, most of which are in rural areas, also likely use 350 ppm sulfur diesel. Gasoline India\u2019s current gasoline standards took effect in 2010. These standards required marked improvements from pre-2010 levels. Benzene limits were reduced from 3% in previously BS III cities and 5% elsewhere to 1% nationwide. The aromatic content limit, which was unregulated under BS II, stands at 42% under BS III norms and 35% under BS IV. Olefins, which were also unregulated under BS II, now stand at 21% and 18% for regular unleaded and premium unleaded, respectively, under BS III and BS IV regulations. Higher olefin content, along with higher Reid vapor pressure (RVP), tends to create more evaporative emissions, which leads to the formation of ozone (O3) and other toxins in the atmosphere. In 2010, sulfur content was lowered to 150 ppm nationwide and 50 ppm in Bharat IV compliant cities. Under BS II, the octane number was increased to 88 and 93 for regular and premium, respectively. It was further increased to 91 and 95 for regular and premium, respectively, under BS III and beyond. With the exception of reduced fuel sulfur content, the gasoline fuel quality mandated by BS VI is similar to that of BS IV fuel. With respect to gasoline sulfur content, India presently lagged behind international best practices. At the start of 2013, 23 cities required no more than 50 ppm sulfur in gasoline, while up to 150 ppm sulfur was allowed in the rest of the country . In 2016, almost half of the country required 50 ppm gasoline. With the implementation of BS VI, India met the standards of international best practices to require 10 ppm sulfur gasoline.",

                "text": "4. Relying on feelings to make decisions Confident people use values-based reasoning to make decisions, not emotion-based reasoning. Imagine the following scenario most of us have found ourselves in in some form or another: Your alarm goes off, you roll over and see that the alarm reads \u201c5:00 AM.\u201d You glance outside, and while it\u2019s still pretty dark, somehow you just know it\u2019s cold out there \u2014 really cold. On the other hand, your bed is so toasty! Which brings you to a decision point: Should you get up and go for that run like you planned? Or hit snooze, roll over, and hopefully hit the gym after work? After a few back and forths with yourself, you decide that it\u2019s just too cold out there, pull your blankets a little closer to you chin, roll over, and promptly fall back asleep. This is emotion-based reasoning. You\u2019ve made a decision based primarily on how you feel, rather than what\u2019s most important to you. Your value was to start exercising regularly to improve your health (and physique, of course!). Your feeling was anxiety over the discomfort of running in the cold and the relief of your warm toasty bed. Ultimately, you decided to stay in bed in order to avoid the discomfort of getting up early and going for a run. Now, I\u2019m not here to tell you that going for a run at 5:00 AM is good or bad, right or wrong, healthy or not. The point is that you made that decision and then chose to act otherwise. And that\u2019s a problem for your confidence. When we consistently act in a way that\u2019s contrary to our own values, we erode our trust in ourselves \u2014 and along with it, our self-confidence. Each time you say something\u2019s important, then act contrary to that commitment, you teach your brain that you can\u2019t be trusted and that you\u2019re not reliable. And the biggest reason we all do this is because our feelings tell us something different. See, our feelings and emotions tend to be oriented toward what feels good in the short-term: Avoiding pain, feeling pleasure, eliminating uncertainty, etc\u2026 Of course, there\u2019s nothing wrong with any of these per se. The problem is, the pursuit of feeling good now, often comes at the expense of doing good in the future: It\u2019s hard to eat healthily, keep off weight, and lower your cholesterol (values), if you constantly decide to pursue the pleasure of a second bowl of ice-cream (feelings). It\u2019s hard to finally write that novel you\u2019ve been dreaming about (value) if you consistently decide to avoid the anxiety of starting a book and choose the easy relief and cheap excitement of video games (feelings). On the other hand, when we regularly follow-through on what we say is important to us, our brain trusts us more. Which means, the next time we\u2019re faced with something difficult, your brain is likely to respond with confidence (Yeah, we got this!) as opposed to fear (I don\u2019t know\u2026 Seems too tough.). If you want to build confidence, you need to change your relationship with your emotions. Begin in small ways to consistently follow through on decisions you\u2019ve committed to, each time knowing that you\u2019re building trust in yourself. And when your brain really starts to trust that you\u2019re the kind of person who goes after what\u2019s really important \u2014 as opposed to what feels good or easy now \u2014 that\u2019s when the confidence comes."

Set in the advent of colonialism and its implications for the native people, the clash of cultures of two different worlds.A story of how a way of life was replaced by another culture.\u201d Kinnie Hindowah \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent example of black African writing in English of which I felt your list was sadly lacking. Black African novelists are often sorely under represented in literary criticism and lists of this kind. In Things Fall Apart, Achebe explores the colonial experience by arguably using the tools of colonialism itself, ie the English language. The story is told from the African perspective and his use of African colloquialisms and proverbs is genuinely subversive and innovative.\u201d Nathan Loughran 2. The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy (1997) \u201cAs a non-native English speaker and someone who grew up in an Asian culture, English as a language appears very articulate and clear to me. And most well written English literature works, including poems, embody such almost straightforward characters, both in their wording and storytelling ... until I read Arundhati Roy\u2019s The God of Small Things. I still remember how struck I was to see the English words be played in a way that\u2019s mostly familiar to me in other Asian literature. The gentle singsong wording and wave-like storytelling combined with the vividness of English captured me like a dream. I\u2019ve read many more English novels since, some as captivating and clever, but none carries the same magic.\u201d Ling \u201cThe God of Small Things \u2013 though a fairly recent book \u2013 resonates very strongly with me. It explores caste, sexism, colonialism and the strange unspoken rules that tie Indian families together. Like in most great novels, the prose itself is stunning, with imagery fresh and original and at the same time, somehow familiar. I\u2019m a girl from a South Indian village and I was raised by a single mother and my grandmother. Perhaps it is this coincidence that ties me so strongly to the book, to see in tangible words the burden that history passes along to Indian women.\u201d Sita \u201cI have never been so moved by a book as this one. Every character is complete and completely human; the plot is intricate and perfectly woven; the sentences sparkle with lapidary precision. When common words fail, she creates her own lexicon (a device I usually loathe in lesser hands) and creates poetry within the prose \u2013 \u2018Furrywhirring,\u2019 \u2018Sariflapping,\u2019 \u2018 OrangedrinkLemondrink Man\u2019, \u2018fatly baffled.\u2019 The description of the God of Small Things or mundane tragedies as a flippant, skipping boy in short pants is as evocative as it is heart breaking. Roy frames tragic personal stories within the context of the greater tragedy of Indian social strictures and politics. And the ending made me cry for two solid hours. I read the book four years ago and writing this critique is making my throat tighten even now, such is its incandescent power and brilliance.\u201d Pam Norris 3. Beloved by Toni Morrison (1987) \u201cBrutal, heartbreaking and beautiful.\u201d Tanith \u201cBeloved is one of the greatest novels ever written \u2013 in any language or culture, any genre or generation, any time or clime. It is a measure of Morrison\u2019s rare and remarkable gift as a writer that one can say of this innovative novel: all humanity is here. It is the most extraordinary excavation of the bones and ghosts of American history (slavery, lynching, Jim Crow segregation), limned in a deeply haunting, profoundly moving multi-layered epic tragedy. With compelling candour, courage and conviction, Morrison\u2019s imperishable masterpiece distils an eerie evocation of mood, setting, landscape and atmosphere, a complex, even complicated deployment of character and characterisation, multiple points of view from an interlude of astutely individuated voices. [...] Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved is, as TS Eliot wrote of James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, \u2018a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\u2019\u201d Idowu Omoyele \u201cThis novel is important to English literature in three respects. Firstly, it not only broaches a significant historical topic (American slavery), but in many ways prescribes solutions to our treatment of slavery\u2019s history. The novel also uses a beautiful and poetic style to hone in its themes. Lastly, Morrison utilises magical realism to enhance the setting and the characters that occupy it. Morrison is one of the first American authors to use magical realism as a primary stylistic choice.\u201d Sean Fortenberry 4. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale by Margaret Atwood (1985) \u201cDespite the passage of time, I have not forgotten how prescient The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was, and how prescient it felt. She described a future that didn\u2019t seem so far-fetched. Living in America gives you a sense, sometimes, that the fundamentalist Christians, with their literalist readings of the Bible, would be capable of reading the story of an infertile woman who had her husband impregnate her handmaid and see that as a solution to infertility in the modern age. And Atwood not only gets the reading of the Bible correct, she also foresaw that we would wreck the planet at the level of reproduction, too. Sometimes, when another \u201ccrazy\u201d thing comes to pass in American politics/culture, I find myself thinking that we\u2019re moving closer to Atwood\u2019s nightmare future. If you combine that prescience with Atwood\u2019s deft handling of language \u2013 she really is a prose virtuosa \u2013 and you have the making of a classic.\u201d Lorraine Berry 5. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy (1985) \u201cMcCarthy is certainly one of the finest living authors in the world today and this novel is his best ... A Texan, his dark descriptions of the American West are second to none. His voice is unique and unmatched in its originality. This is a novel which hypnotises, horrifies and leaves the reader as dazed as man who has stood too close to freight-train as it has roared by his head. Jolting and vividly spattered with blood, the pages brand themselves deeply into the readers memory and imagination: A true American masterpiece crafted by a true master.\u201d Mark Hall \u201cIt is the best novel written in the twentieth century. It tells a fascinating and complex story with incredible power. It demonstrates McCarthy\u2019s total mastery of both language and narrative. It has arguably the greatest villain ever written. It shows the utter superfluousness of punctuation. It evokes a little-known period in American history with startling beauty and incredible realism.\u201d TheMarxOfProgress \u201cMccarthy\u2019s novel is a masterpiece with a nihilistic bent and lurid prose. The Judge is one of the most sinister characters in the history of literature.\u201d Jay Tucker 6. A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry (1995) \u201cThis is the one book that whisked me away to India. It shows you a world that you\u2019ve maybe never thought about before, it makes you feel empathy for the struggles of Indian beggars, it shows you what life was like in the countryside and in the city. It\u2019s a caleidoscope of people and stories. It educates you about Indian politics and history. And it\u2019s a very moving book as well. It can bring tears into your eyes (not mine of course, I\u2019m talking about a friend...)\u201d Isabelle Meyer \u201cA great and fluid command of the language, an achingly accurate portrayal of the complexity of human choices, startling humour in places you least expect, tender treatment of the tragedy that is the human condition... This book takes you right into the drama of ordinary, seemingly forgettable lives.\u201d Vivian Ligo \u201cIt is a beautifully written, tragic tale of how four characters from different backgrounds join together, but how their lives follow different paths because of their caste. Even though it\u2019s so very sad, there is so much love and humour and the irony that it\u2019s the \u2018luckiest\u2019 character who is the most miserable!\u201d Kim 7. Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace (1996) \u201cDavid Foster Wallace was a creative force that measured the disillusion and sadness of a generation of people who felt emptiness that took a shape that no-one could really identify or wrestle with. Infinite Jest, his magnum opus, represents all of these feelings and more. It is a work that confronts the substance of how happiness is truly fleeting. A work over-brimming with intelligence, humour, pathos and insight. I can think of few works that capture the mood of a time as Infinite Jest does. It is prescient, chilling, hilarious, comforting, and all of it simultaneously.\u201d Ben James \u201cThe best writer of his generation has to have a spot on the list. The best novel of the past 20 years is hilarious, sad and absurd \u2013 often within the same page. At over 1,000 pages you\u2019ll struggle through bits of it, and suddenly you\u2019ll realise you\u2019ve finished and want to immediately start again.\u201d Jay Tucker 8. Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut (1969) \u201cSlaughterhouse Five is an eclectic telling of a tragedy told by Vonnegut, who was there during the Dresden bombing. It brings a unique satire to an otherwise terrible event and it is told with poignancy. Vonnegut\u2019s anti-war story was a triumph of literature.\u201d Mario Velarde \u201cSuch a short and easy to read book, it takes an interesting, quirky and meaningful approach to a horrific event in our history. Very imaginative, poignant and at times shocking, it has stayed with me for a long time each time I\u2019ve read it.\u201d Ciara Dawson 9. The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien (1954 - 1955) \u201cTolkien defined the Fantasy genre with his epic storytelling and world building.\u201d Gerd Duerner \u201cSetting up the genre for the next six decades, there is simply no other work of literature this ambitious. Powerful, profound, poignant, and linguistically pure.\u201d Jorge \u201cIt is an incredibly well written book by a very talented man. A masterpiece that inspired many writers in the genre. To me, it was a book that helped me through some dark times. It inspired me with the beauty of the writing (Tolkien is a masterful writer), and the great messages within the story.\u201d Kim Anisi 10. I, Lucifer by Glen Duncan (2003) \u201cIt makes a protagonist of he who is literature\u2019s all-time ultimate villain and simultaneously the personification of all villainy. With this character at the book\u2019s heart, the author explores, amongst many other themes, some of humanity\u2019s darkest and most dreadful moral transgressions. Duncan manages this with unflinching clarity, intelligently devised detail and a craftsman\u2019s weave of one-liners, observational humour, hilarious characters and broadly applied satire. To me, while first reading it, then returning immediately to the first page for another go, it was clear that I may never enjoy a novel so much again. That has stuck true for over ten years now.\u201d David Pooley \u201cIt manages to answer the primal questions about the relationship between God & the Devil. A reasonably good theologian could probably shoot it down in flames, but like Milton\u2019s Satan, he is beautiful, bright and flawed. Duncan writes like an angel and Lucifer ... well, you\u2019ll just have to read it.\u201d Laura Andrus 11. Harry Potter series by JK Rowling (1997-2007) \u201cA good novel will leave you a different person than when you began it, and I honestly don\u2019t think there are any books that have changed so many people\u2019s lives like Harry Potter novels have. While perhaps not the best written books when compared to other masterpieces on the list, the detail of the Harry Potter universe and the engaging characters and storylines are works of genius. Rowling captures the imagination like no other author can, and that is why she deserves to be on the list of greatest novels.\u201d Andrew Thornbury \u201cI have chosen this series because it means something to me both as a reader and a teacher. I have seen children that wouldn\u2019t usually choose reading as a way to pass the time become completely engrossed in these books. It is also true to say that if you enjoy reading something as a young person, there is a likelihood that you will also enjoy re-reading the same text. As a child I very much enjoyed reading these, and I still do today!\u201d Charlotte Fox 12. Lanark: A Life in Four Books by Alasdair Gray (1981) \u201cThis is the key work in contemporary Scottish fiction, which initiates the renaissance in Scottish writing. Its influence can also be detected across the wider \u2018postmodern\u2019 context, by pushing the frontiers of the novel. No Ali Smith, David Mitchell, Will Self et al without Lanark.\u201d Edmund Smyth \u201cThe greatest Scottish novel of 20th century: personal and political, parochial and universal, it strides across the realist and fantasy genres with a playful but urgent post-modernism.\u201d Grant Rintoul 13. Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert A Heinlein (1961) \u201cWhy no sci-fi? Stranger in a Strange Land, Heinlein\u2019s masterpiece, transcends the genre, as it is as much a groundbreaking social, political, religious, and sexual commentary on what it is to be human, obliterating taboos of the era. It was way ahead of its time. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Jubal Harshaw has to be one of the most memorable characters in all of fiction.\u201d Michael Yaros \u201cThis novel correctly defined \u2018love\u2019 for me, as \u2018the state in which the welfare and happiness of another become essential to your own.\u2019\u201d Spider Robinson 14. The Color Purple by Alice Walker (1982) \u201cAs a non-white, non-Western reader of English language fiction since early childhood, I had begun to internalise the idea that good fiction needed to meet the standards set by dead straight white men. Then when I was 18 I read this novel and it blew my mind \u2013 the narrative voice, characters and plot sensitised me to racism and sexism in ways that I had never encountered (and have yet to encounter) in novels authored by straight white men. And though I am not an African-American woman, it validated and enlarged my existence, which is what I think the best fiction is capable of.\u201d Shanon Shah \u201cAny list of great books needs to include this, or is simply incomplete. The Color Purple was the first book that truly touched me and really forced me to think.\u201d Denise Paradise 15. Woman on the Edge of Time by Marge Piercy (1976) \u201cThis was a life-changing work for me. It totally changed the way I looked at time, gender, race, sanity, utopia and dystopia. I first read it in my late teens and I\u2019ve reread it frequently. I always find something new, or interpret it slightly differently. It questions why we need gender designation, offering a gender neutral \u2018per\u2019. It offers a three-parent society. It contrasts sexism, racism and the chemical coshing of a mental health patient with a utopia that doesn\u2019t contain any of these issues. It leaves us with the idea that, in interfering with the mind, as the central character\u2019s brain is operated on, we change the possible future available to us. It touched on so many issues that matter in my life, and in society generally, that the added question of what reality means became academic.\u201d Laura Albero \u201cThe book is inspired and is aesthetically superb and socially salvific.\u201d The Revd Linda Isiorho Do you have a book to add to the list?

The first \u2018seven wonders of the ancient world\u2019 list was made more than 2000 years ago, by adventurous Hellenic travelers who marveled at the world\u2019s most incredible man-made constructions. Since then, most of the original list have been destroyed, aside from the Great Pyramid of Giza. In 2001, Swiss-born, Canadian filmmaker Bernard Weber set up the New7Wonders Foundation to find a new seven wonders of the world for the modern era, asking members of the public to cast their votes. After months of deliberating, debating and shortlists, these are the impressive feats that made the final cut. 1. The Colosseum, Rome, Italy The Colosseum, in Rome, Italy, image courtesy of National Geographic The Colosseum is the great oval amphitheater in the center of Rome where gladiators once fought for their life. The largest amphitheater ever built, it was constructed from sand and stone over eight years, from AD72 to AD80. The colossal structure could hold 80,000 spectators, arranged in a circular ring around the central stage. Dramatic and sometimes horrifying events took place here, not just gladiatorial games, but also Classical plays, animal hunts and executions. Some say water was even pumped into the arena to enact mock sea battles. Partially damaged by earthquakes and stone robbers over the centuries, the Colosseum is still an iconic memento of Roman history, visited by thousands of tourists every year, so it stands to reason it would make the list of today\u2019s seven wonders of the world. 2. The Great Wall of China The Great Wall of China is a huge barrier that spans thousands of miles along China\u2019s historic northern border. Created over millennia, the wall began its life as a series of smaller walls dating back to the 7th century BCE, built as protective barriers against nomadic raids. In 220 BCE, China\u2019s first Emperor Qin Shi Huang masterminded the unification of all China\u2019s walls into one almighty barrier, strengthening and extending the wall to keep out northern invaders. Today the wall is recognized as one of the seven wonders, which, including all its branches, measures a whopping 13,171 miles. 3. The Taj Mahal, India The Taj Mahal, image courtesy of Architectural Digest Get the latest articles delivered to your inbox Sign up to our Free Weekly Newsletter Join! Please check your inbox to activate your subscription Thank you! India\u2019s renowned Taj Mahal (Persian for Crown of Palaces) is the stunning white marble mausoleum on the bank of the Yamuna River in the city of Agra, and it has been selected as one of the seven wonders of the world. Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan built the temple as a tomb for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth in 1631. A marble tomb in the center is surrounded by 42 acres of grounds, where gardens, a mosque, guest house and pool complete the complex. The entire project took over 22 years to complete by 20,000 workers at a cost of 32 million rupees (around US$827 million by today\u2019s standards). But the hard work paid off \u2013 today the Taj Mahal is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a vital component of India\u2019s rich Mughal history. 4. Christ the Redeemer, Brazil Christ the Redeemer, image courtesy of Conde Nast Magazine The totemic statue of Christ the Redeemer stands over Rio de Janeiro on the top of Mount Corcovado. At 30 meters tall, this monument is an iconic emblem of Brazil. This huge public artwork was designed by the Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski in the 1920s and completed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, and French engineer Albert Caquot in 1931. Made from reinforced concrete clad in over 6 million soapstone tiles, Christ the Redeemer is the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. Built just after the end of the First World War, the sculpture was an overpowering symbol of Christianity and hope when the world had been brought to its knees, so its no surprise that this monument made the list for today\u2019s seven wonders. 5. Machu Picchu, Peru Machu Picchu, image courtesy of Business Insider Australia Machu Picchu is a lost treasure of the 15th century, a rare citadel discovered high in the Andes mountains above the Peruvian Sacred Valley. Astonishingly, it is one of the only pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact, featuring evidence of former plazas, temples, agricultural terraces and homes. Archaeologists believe the citadel was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti in around 1450 in polished drystone walls. The Incas abandoned the site a century later and it remained hidden for millennia, before being brought to public attention by American historian Hiram Bingham in 1911. Because of this remarkable preservation, it is recognized today as one of the seven wonders. 6. Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Mexico Chichen Itza, image courtesy of Air France Deep in the Mexican state of Yucat\u00e1n lies Chichen Itza, a historic Mayan city built between the 9th and 12th centuries. Constructed by the pre-Columbian Mayan tribe Itz\u00e1, the city includes a series of monuments and temples. The most celebrated is El Castillo, also known as the Temple of Kukulcan. It is a huge step pyramid in the center of the city which was built as a devotional temple to the god Kukulkan. In total, the entire temple features 365 steps, one for each day of the year. Even more impressively, during the spring and summer equinoxes, afternoon sun casts triangular shadows down the pyramid\u2019s north stairway that resemble a feathered serpent slithering down its surface, heading towards a stone snake head at the base \u2013 no wonder it is one of the seven wonders today! 7. Petra, Jordan Petra, the ancient city in southern Jordan, is also known as the \u2018rose city\u2019 for its golden hue. It dates as far back as 312 BC. Set in a remote valley, this ancient city was founded by the Arab Nabataeans, a sophisticated civilization that carved stunning architecture and complex waterways out of surrounding rock faces. The Nabateans also established Petra as a successful trade hub, earning vast wealth and a booming population before being wiped out by earthquakes. Unknown to the Western world for centuries, the city was uncovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. 19th-century poet and scholar John William Burgon described Petra as \u201ca rose-red city half as old as time.\u201d"

Popuar Soft Drinks If you look in your nearest store, you can find up to a dozens of types of soft drinks, all made from different manufacturers. Here you can find out more about both drink brands and companies who created them. Brief History First artificially made carbonated water and drinks were made in late 1700s, but the origins of those drinks can be found even 2 thousand years ago in ancient Greece and Roman empires who started noticing beneficiary medicinal effects of natural springs that produced carbonated water. Because of these medicinal effects, many inventors tried to emulate this effect of carbonization in chemical laboratories. First two men who managed to do that were Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman and English scientist Joseph Priestley in second half of 18th century. After their discovery, others inventors started developing their processes, many patents were issued, manufacture started, and general population of United States and Europe got the chance to taste first new products carbonated water and soft drink products. It is important to mention that one of the reasons why sugary soft drinks managed to become so popular was not only because they were initially targeted as a \u201cfun summer drink\u201d, but also because pharmacist infused early soft drink recipes with powerful stimulants that actively tried to change the emotional state of the user. Most popular of these stimulants were coffee, cola nuts and coca leaves, all able to ward off fatigue and clear mind for brief moments. The most popular soft drink in the world Coca-Cola made by John Pemberton in 1886 has used just that principle \u2013 mixture of water, sweetener, caramel flavoring and extract of cola leaves. The exact mixture of Coca-Cola is still closely guarded secret. History of soft drinks can generally be separated into several distinct parts: Age of Soda Fountains \u2013 Popular devices that mix the ingredients of soda drinks on the spot, often housed at concession stands, pharmacies, train/bus stations, stores and other locations. For more than 100 years they were main source of soda drink sales around the world. They were surpassed by glass bottles and vending machines in first half of 20th century. Age of Soda Can \u2013 Advances in industrial manufacture of aluminum enabled soft drink produces to start packaging their products into cans in late 1950s. Introduction of this new packaging format marked a beginning of the modern era of soft drinks, era that is still active today. Appearance of Diet Soda drinks \u2013 Late 1950s and early 1960s witnessed the birth of sweetened soft drinks that switched from sugar to artificial sweeteners that significantly lowered the caloric value of carbonated drinks. This move was initially slow, but was quickly kick-started into higher gear with the introduction of Tab in 1963, Diet 7 Up in 1979 and Diet Coke in 1982."

Traditional fried chicken is the epitome of comfort food, but its appeal and history go far beyond the way we know it today. Although its origins are evident in other cultures such as Scotland, Korea and China, we typically associate fried chicken with the American South. What is universally true about it is that it is deeply satisfying. KFC fried chicken There are a wide range of restaurants that offer fried chicken on their menus. From KFC and Chick-fil-a to upscale trendy restaurants, there is a bit of a trend that can satisfy the cravings of fried chicken lovers in a variety of settings and price points. But that is not to say that making fried chicken at home is out of your grasp. It is certainly a worthwhile endeavor for those who want that crunchy exterior that yields to its juicy, tender interior with all of the flavor and texture that we have come to expect. While enjoying fried chicken at a restaurant can be really delicious, what you really miss is the flexibility of creating a dish that caters to your own tastes. Making KFC fried chicken at home allows you the opportunity to customize it to suit your preferences. The major benefit to frying chicken at home is the freedom to choose the oil, chicken & seasoning of your liking. In the end, you will no doubt find that your effort was certainly worth it when you finally roll up your sleeves, dive into that fried chicken, and taste what comfort food is all about. Preparation 1. Choosing chicken: For starters, you can choose what kind of chicken you prefer. Be it boneless thighs, or a whole bird that is cut into pieces, you can be selective. Most people love fried drumsticks. But you can also use chicken breasts & thighs. White meat, dark, or an assortment of the two can please your own tastes, as well as your guests\u2019. The point here is to use what works for you. For this recipe you will need 500 grams of chicken of your choice. 2. Brining: Next is the decision to brine or not to brine. The benefit of using a buttermilk brine is that it tenderizes the chicken and adds moisture while contributing a pleasing kiss of acidity. While skipping this step is an option, a soak in buttermilk for at least 4 hours will take your fried chicken to new heights which is certainly worth the extra planning. To make the butter milk, add \u00bd cup plain yogurt to a bowl and whisk it with 1 cup water. Add about \u00bc teaspoon salt & give a good mix. You can also add some crushed black pepper if you like. 3. Rinse chicken and add it here. Cover the bowl with a cling wrap and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight. Overnight gives best results. I do not suggest skipping this as the chicken won\u2019t cook through properly without brining. 4. When you are ready to make the fried chicken prepare the crumbs for coating. To a bowl add, 1 cup bread crumbs or panko crumbs. I used \u00bc teaspoon allspice & \u00bd teaspoon red chilli powder or paprika. These are optional and you may add any other seasoning if you prefer here. 5. Break an egg to a bowl and separate the white. 6. Remove the chicken pieces one after the other from the buttermilk and add them a large mixing bowl. Or drain the buttermilk from the chicken. We don\u2019t want the buttermilk here. Seasoning How you chose to bread the chicken is another way to create the fried chicken you are craving. Keeping it really neutral with just salt and pepper is absolutely fine, though adding a mix of herbs and spices will give it something truly special. Even a touch of cayenne pepper for some extra kick would please some tastes. 7. My recipe uses all of the below seasonings. You may adjust to suit your taste. Add the following to the chicken. 1 teaspoon red chilli powder \u00bd teaspoon ground black pepper 1 teaspoon mixed herbs (oregano, thyme, basil) \u00bd teaspoon salt \u00be tablespoon garlic powder (or crushed garlic) 1 teaspoon onion powder \u00bc teaspoon allspice (or 1 tsp garam masala). Rub the chicken well with all this seasoning for 2 to 3 mins. Then add 2 tablespoons cornstarch and mix everything well to coat the chicken with the flour. How to make kfc fried chicken 8. Pour the egg white to the chicken and 3 to 4 tablespoons buttermilk. Mix well. Chicken must be moist enough to hold the bread crumbs at the next stage. Pick up each piece of chicken & roll them in the bread crumbs. 9. Press down each piece of chicken so the bread crumbs stick to the chicken well. Set aside for at least 10 minutes. A better way is to place these on a wired rack. Choosing oil Selecting a neutral oil with a high smoke point is key here so vegetable, canola, or peanut oil are all good options. You want to steer clear of olive oil, due to its lower smoke point, as well as its tendency to transfer its flavor to whatever you are cooking. You want the chicken to be the star of the show here, so no added flavor from oil is best. 10. Heat oil of your choice in a heavy bottom deep pan. Check if the oil is hot enough. Then gently shake off the excess bread crumbs and add the breaded chicken to the hot oil. Fry till golden & crisp at medium high temperature. The oil should be hot enough and the flame at medium high. Temperature: Optimal oil temperature here is right around 350 F degrees. Hotter than that, and you will risk burning the exterior before the chicken is thoroughly cooked. 11. Once done, remove them to a kitchen towel and leave for 30 seconds. Then immediately move to a wired rack so they remain crisp for longer. If the chicken is not cooked through, you may refry them on a medium heat. Enjoy fried chicken with your favorite dip or ketchup. Equipment for fried chicken The great news is that you really do not need any special equipment when making fried chicken at home. In terms of equipment, here are a few things I would strongly recommend: A large, deep pan or Dutch oven (4-6 quart) helps to retain the temperature of oil consistently while frying. However you can also use a heavy bottom regular deep pan like the way I have used. If you are a beginner, an instant read thermometer is key for determining doneness of the chicken. A large rack for draining the chicken when it comes out of the oil will help retain that crunchy exterior you worked so hard to achieve. Air fryer fried chicken For those health-conscious cooks who crave fried chicken, but want to steer clear of deep frying, an air fryer may be the ticket. Bear in mind that an air fryer really is not a fryer at all, but rather, a small convection oven that circulates hot air with the use of a fan. This dry heat method has been known to create crisp results with a golden brown crust. The key here is to use perforated parchment sheets to line the air fryer basket and spray the surface of the chicken with an oil spray. I would recommend cooking at about 375 F (190 C) degrees, depending on your machine\u2019s suggestions, and about 25 minutes depending on size. To determine doneness, always check the temperature with an instant read thermometer and make sure you cook it to 165 degrees. Baking KFC chicken Alternately, baking your breaded chicken in the oven will deliver tasty results, but with slightly less crunch. In this case, start by preparing your baking pan with a generous coating of oil. Place your chicken on the pan, skin side down, and bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, depending on size of your chicken, turning once at the halfway point. What you will end up with is really tasty breaded chicken that will satisfy the likes of more healthy eaters.

                "text": "This article will explain the different nutrients a person needs and why. It will also look at the role of the dietitian and the nutritionist. Nutrients provide nourishment. Proteins, carbohydrates , fat, vitamins , minerals, fiber, and water are all nutrients. If people do not have the right balance of nutrients in their diet, their risk of developing certain health conditions increases. Nutrition also focuses on how people can use dietary choices to reduce the risk of disease, what happens if a person has too much or too little of a nutrient, and how allergies work. Nutritionists use ideas from molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics to understand how nutrients affect the human body. Nutrition is the study of nutrients in food, how the body uses them, and the relationship between diet, health, and disease. For more science-backed resources on nutrition, visit our dedicated hub . Click here to find out how much water a person needs each day and here to learn about the benefits of drinking water. Requirements will also depend on an individual\u2019s body size and age, environmental factors, activity levels, health status, and so on. Many people recommend consuming 2 liters, or 8 glasses, of water a day, but it can also come from dietary sources, such as fruit and vegetables. Adequate hydration will result in pale yellow urine. The adult human body is up to 60% water, and it needs water for many processes. Water contains no calories , and it does not provide energy. However, the type of fat a person eats makes a difference. Unsaturated fats, such as olive oil, are more healthful than saturated fats, which tend to come from animals. Too much fat can lead to obesity , high cholesterol , liver disease, and other health problems. Most plant-based foods do not contain complete protein, so a person who follows a vegan diet needs to eat a range of foods throughout the day that provides the essential amino acids. Some foods provide complete protein, which means they contain all the essential amino acids the body needs. Other foods contain various combinations of amino acids. There are 20 amino acids . Some of these are essential , which means people need to obtain them from food. The body can make the others. Proteins consist of amino acids, which are organic compounds that occur naturally. Fiber and unprocessed starch are complex carbs. It takes the body some time to break down and absorb complex carbs. After eating fiber, a person will feel full for longer. Fiber may also reduce the risk of diabetes , cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer . Complex carbs are a more healthful choice than sugars and refined carbs. Fiber is also a carbohydrate. The body breaks down some types of fiber and uses them for energ; others are metabolized by gut bacteria, while other types pass through the body. Sugars are simple carbs. The body quickly breaks down and absorbs sugars and processed starch. They can provide rapid energy, but they do not leave a person feeling full. They can also cause a spike in blood sugar levels. Frequent sugar spikes increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications. Sugar, starch, and fiber are types of carbohydrates. Macronutrients are nutrients that people need in relatively large quantities. Micronutrients are essential in small amounts. They include vitamins and minerals. Manufacturers sometimes add these to foods. Examples include fortified cereals and rice. Minerals The body needs carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. It also needs dietary minerals, such as iron, potassium, and so on. In most cases, a varied and balanced diet will provide the minerals a person needs. If a deficiency occurs, a doctor may recommend supplements. Here are some of the minerals the body needs to function well. Potassium Potassium is an electrolyte. It enables the kidneys, the heart, the muscles, and the nerves to work properly. The 2015\u20132020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults consume 4,700 milligrams (mg) of potassium each day. Too little can lead to high blood pressure, stroke, and kidney stones. Too much may be harmful to people with kidney disease. Avocados, coconut water, bananas, dried fruit, squash, beans, and lentils are good sources. Learn more here about potassium. Sodium Sodium is an electrolyte that helps: maintain nerve and muscle function regulate fluid levels in the body Too little can lead to hyponatremia. Symptoms include lethargy, confusion, and fatigue. Learn more here. Too much can lead to high blood pressure, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Table salt, which is made up of sodium and chloride, is a popular condiment. However, most people consume too much sodium, as it already occurs naturally in most foods. Experts urge people not to add table salt to their diet. Current guidelines recommend consuming no more than 2,300 mg of sodium a day, or around one teaspoon. This recommendation includes both naturally-occurring sources, as well as salt a person adds to their food. People with high blood pressure or kidney disease should eat less. How much salt does a person need? Find out here. Calcium The body needs calcium to form bones and teeth. It also supports the nervous system, cardiovascular health, and other functions. Too little can cause bones and teeth to weaken. Symptoms of a severe deficiency include tingling in the fingers and changes in heart rhythm, which can be life-threatening. Too much can lead to constipation, kidney stones, and reduced absorption of other minerals. Current guidelines for adults recommend consuming 1,000 mg a day, and 1,200 mg for women aged 51 and over. Good sources include dairy products, tofu, legumes,and green, leafy vegetables. Find out more about calcium. Phosphorus Phosphorus is present in all body cells and contributes to the health of the bones and teeth. Too little phosphorus can lead to bone diseases, affect appetite, muscle strength, and coordination. It can also result in anemia, a higher risk of infection, burning or prickling sensations in the skin, and confusion. Too much in the diet is unlikely to cause health problems though toxicity is possible from supplements, medications, and phosphorus metabolism problems. Adults should aim to consume around 700 mg of phosphorus each day. Good sources include dairy products, salmon, lentils, and cashews. Why do people need phosphorus? Find out here. Magnesium Magnesium contributes to muscle and nerve function. It helps regulate blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and it enables the body to produce proteins, bone, and DNA. Too little magnesium can eventually lead to weakness, nausea, tiredness, restless legs, sleep conditions, and other symptoms. Too much can result in digestive and, eventually, heart problems. Nuts, spinach, and beans are good sources of magnesium. Adult females need 320 mg of magnesium each day, and adult males need 420 mg. Why is magnesium essential? Click here to learn more. Zinc Zinc plays a role in the health of body cells, the immune system, wound healing, and the creation of proteins. Too little can lead to hair loss, skin sores, changes in taste or smell,and diarrhea, but this is rare. Too much can lead to digestive problems and headaches. Click here to learn more. Adult females need 8 mg of zinc a day, and adult males need 11 mg. Dietary sources include oysters, beef, fortified breakfast cereals, and baked beans. For more on dietary sources of zinc, click here. How does zinc benefit a person\u2019s health? Click here to find out. Iron Iron is crucial for the formation of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of the body. It also plays a role in forming connective tissue and creating hormones. Too little can result in anemia, including digestive issues, weakness, and difficulty thinking. Learn more here about iron deficiency. Too much can lead to digestive problems, and very high levels can be fatal. Good sources include fortified cereals, beef liver, lentils, spinach, and tofu. Adults need 8 mg of iron a day, but females need 18 mg during their reproductive years. Why is iron important? Find out here. Manganese The body uses manganese to produce energy , it plays a role in blood clotting, and it supports the immune system. Too little can result in weak bones in children, skin rashes in men, and mood changes in women. Too much can lead to tremors, muscle spasms, and other symptoms, but only with very high amounts. Mussels, hazelnuts, brown rice, chickpeas, and spinach all provide manganese. Male adults need 2.3 mg of manganese each day, and females need 1.8 mg. Find out more here about manganese. Copper Copper helps the body make energy and produce connective tissues and blood vessels. Too little copper can lead to tiredness, patches of light skin, high cholesterol, and connective tissue disorders. This is rare. Too much copper can result in liver damage, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Too much copper also reduces the absorption of zinc. Good sources include beef liver, oysters, potatoes, mushrooms, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds. Adults need 900 micrograms (mcg) of copper each day. Why is copper important? Click here to find out. Selenium Selenium is made up of over 24 selenoproteins, and it plays a crucial role in reproductive and thyroid health. As an antioxidant, it can also prevent cell damage. Too much selenium can cause garlic breath, diarrhea, irritability, skin rashes, brittle hair or nails, and other symptoms. Too little can result in heart disease, infertility in men, and arthritis. Adults need 55 mcg of selenium a day. Brazil nuts are an excellent source of selenium. Other plant sources include spinach, oatmeal, and baked beans. Tuna, ham, and enriched macaroni are all excellent sources. Learn more about selenium here. Vitamins Share on Pinterest Eating a variety of healthful foods can provide the body with different vitamins. People need small amounts of various vitamins. Some of these, such as vitamin C, are also antioxidants. This means they help protect cells from damage by removing toxic molecules, known as free radicals, from the body. Vitamins can be: Water-soluble: The eight B vitamins and vitamin C Fat-soluble: Vitamins A, D, E, and K Learn more about vitamins here. Water soluble vitamins People need to consume water-soluble vitamins regularly because the body removes them more quickly, and it cannot store them easily. Vitamin Effect of too little Effect of too much Sources B-1 ( thiamin ) Beriberi Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome Unclear, as the body excretes it in the urine. Fortified cereals and rice, pork, trout, black beans B-2 ( riboflavin ) Hormonal problems, skin disorders, swelling in the mouth and throat Unclear, as the body excretes it in the urine. Beef liver, breakfast cereal, oats, yogurt, mushrooms, almonds B-3 ( niacin ) Pellagra, including skin changes, red tongue, digestive and neurological symptoms Facial flushing, burning, itching, headaches, rashes, and dizziness Beef liver, chicken breast, brown rice, fortified cereals, peanuts. B-5 ( pantothenic acid ) Numbness and burning in hands and feet, fatigue, stomach pain Digestive problems at high doses. Breakfast cereal, beef liver, shiitake mushroom, sunflower seeds B-6 ( pyridoxamine, pyridoxal ) Anemia, itchy rash, skin changes, swollen tongue Nerve damage, loss of muscle control Chickpeas, beef liver, tuna, chicken breast, fortified cereals, potatoes B-7 ( biotin ) Hair loss, rashes around the eyes and other body openings, conjunctivitis Unclear Beef liver, egg, salmon, sunflower seeds, sweet potato B-9 ( folic acid, folate ) Weakness, fatigue, difficulty focusing, heart palpitations, shortness of breath May increase cancer risk Beef liver, spinach, black-eyed peas, fortified cereal, asparagus B-12 ( cobalamins ) Anemia, fatigue, constipation, weight loss, neurological changes No adverse effects reported Clams, beef liver, fortified yeasts, plant milks, and breakfast cereals, some oily fish. Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) Scurvy, including fatigue, skin rash, gum inflammation, poor wound healing Nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramps Citrus fruits, berries, red and green peppers, kiwi fruit, broccoli, baked potatoes, fortified juices. Fat-soluble vitamins The body absorbs fat-soluble vitamins through the intestines with the help of fats (lipids). The body can store them and does not remove them quickly. People who follow a low-fat diet may not be able to absorb enough of these vitamins. If too many build up, problems can arise. Vitamin Effect of too little Effect of too much Sources Vitamin A ( retinoids ) Night blindness Pressure on the brain, nausea, dizziness, skin irritation, joint and bone pain, orange pigmented skin color Sweet potato, beef liver, spinach, and other dark leafy greens, carrots, winter squash Vitamin D Poor bone formation and weak bones Anorexia, weight loss, changes in heart rhythm, damage to cardiovascular system and kidneys Sunlight exposure plus dietary sources: cod liver oil, oily fish, dairy products, fortified juices Vitamin E Peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy, reduced immune response May reduce the ability of blood to clot Wheatgerm, nuts, seeds, sunflower and safflower oil, spinach Vitamin K Bleeding and hemorrhaging in severe cases No adverse effects but it may interact with blood thinners and other drugs Leafy, green vegetables, soybeans, edamame, okra, natto Multivitamins are available for purchase in stores or online, but people should speak to their doctor before taking any supplements, to check that they are suitable for them to use. Antioxidants Some nutrients also act as antioxidants. These may be vitamins, minerals, proteins, or other types of molecules. They help the body remove toxic substances known as free radicals, or reactive oxygen species. If too many of these substances remain in the body, cell damage and disease can result. Find out more here about antioxidants. Here, learn which foods are good sources of antioxidants.",

                "text": "From the invention of tools made for hunting to advances in food production and agriculture to early examples of art and religion, this enormous time span\u2014ending roughly 3,200 years ago (dates vary upon region)\u2014was a period of great transformation. Here\u2019s a closer look: Earth\u2019s beginnings can be traced back 4.5 billion years, but human evolution only counts for a tiny speck of its history. The Prehistoric Period\u2014or when there was human life before records documented human activity\u2014roughly dates from 2.5 million years ago to 1,200 B.C. It is generally categorized in three archaeological periods: the Stone Age , Bronze Age and Iron Age . The Stone Age Prisma/Universal Images Group/Getty Images Early human ancestors painting a bison inside a cave during the Paleolithic Age. Divided into three periods: Paleolithic (or Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (or Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (or New Stone Age), this era is marked by the use of tools by our early human ancestors (who evolved around 300,000 B.C.) and the eventual transformation from a culture of hunting and gathering to farming and food production. During this era, early humans shared the planet with a number of now-extinct hominin relatives, including Neanderthals and Denisovans. In the Paleolithic period (roughly 2.5 million years ago to 10,000 B.C.), early humans lived in caves or simple huts or tepees and were hunters and gatherers. They used basic stone and bone tools, as well as crude stone axes, for hunting birds and wild animals. They cooked their prey, including woolly mammoths, deer and bison, using controlled fire. They also fished and collected berries, fruit and nuts. Ancient humans in the Paleolithic period were also the first to leave behind art. They used combinations of minerals, ochres, burnt bone meal and charcoal mixed into water, blood, animal fats and tree saps to etch humans, animals and signs. They also carved small figurines from stones, clay, bones and antlers. The end of this period marked the end of the last Ice Age, which resulted in the extinction of many large mammals and rising sea levels and climate change that eventually caused man to migrate. Ann Ronan Pictures/Print Collector/Getty Images The Shell Mound People, or Kitchen-Middeners, were hunter-gatherers of the late Mesolithic and early Neolithic period. They get their name from the distinctive mounds (middens) of shells and other kitchen debris they left behind. During the Mesolithic period (about 10,000 B.C. to 8,000 B.C.), humans used small stone tools, now also polished and sometimes crafted with points and attached to antlers, bone or wood to serve as spears and arrows. They often lived nomadically in camps near rivers and other bodies of water. Agriculture was introduced during this time, which led to more permanent settlements in villages. Finally, during the Neolithic period (roughly 8,000 B.C. to 3,000 B.C.), ancient humans switched from hunter/gatherer mode to agriculture and food production. They domesticated animals and cultivated cereal grains. They used polished hand axes, adzes for plowing and tilling the land and started to settle in the plains. Advancements were made not only in tools but also in farming, home construction and art, including pottery, sewing and weaving. The Bronze Age English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images Village life in Grimspound, a late Bronze Age settlement situated on Dartmoor in Devon, England. During the Bronze Age (about 3,000 B.C. to 1,300 B.C.), metalworking advances were made, as bronze, a copper and tin alloy, was discovered. Now used for weapons and tools, the harder metal replaced its stone predecessors, and helped spark innovations including the ox-drawn plow and the wheel. This time period also brought advances in architecture and art, including the invention of the potter\u2019s wheel, and textiles\u2014clothing consisted of mostly wool items such as skirts, kilts, tunics and cloaks. Home dwellings morphed to so-called roundhouses, consisting of a circular stone wall with a thatched or turf roof, complete with a fireplace or hearth, and more villages and cities began to form. Organized government, law and warfare, as well as the beginnings of religion, also came into play during the Bronze Age, perhaps most notably relating to the ancient Egyptians who built the pyramids during this time. The earliest written accounts, including Egyptian hieroglyphs and petroglyphs (rock engravings), are also dated to this era. The Iron Age English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images Home life during the Iron Age. The discovery of ways to heat and forge iron kicked off the Iron Age (roughly 1,300 B.C. to 900 B.C.). At the time, metal was seen as more precious than gold, and wrought iron (which would be replaced by steel with the advent of smelting iron) was easier to manufacture than bronze. Along with mass production of iron tools and weapons, the age saw even further advances in architecture, with four-room homes, some complete with stables for animals, joining more rudimentary hill forts, as well as royal palaces, temples and other religious structures. Early city planning also took place, with blocks of homes being erected along paved or cobblestone streets and water systems put into place. Agriculture, art and religion all became more sophisticated, and writing systems and written documentation, including alphabets, began to emerge, ushering in the Early Historical Period."

                "text": "The emergence and spread of infectious diseases with pandemic potential occurred regularly throughout history. Major pandemics and epidemics such as plague, cholera, flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have already afflicted humanity. The world is now facing the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Many infectious diseases leading to pandemics are caused by zoonotic pathogens that were transmitted to humans due to increased contacts with animals through breeding, hunting and global trade activities. The understanding of the mechanisms of transmission of pathogens to humans allowed the establishment of methods to prevent and control infections. During centuries, implementation of public health measures such as isolation, quarantine and border control helped to contain the spread of infectious diseases and maintain the structure of the society. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, these containment methods have still been used nowadays to control COVID-19 pandemic. Global surveillance programs of water-borne pathogens, vector-borne diseases and zoonotic spillovers at the animal-human interface are of prime importance to rapidly detect the emergence of infectious threats. Novel technologies for rapid diagnostic testing, contact tracing, drug repurposing, biomarkers of disease severity as well as new platforms for the development and production of vaccines are needed for an effective response in case of pandemics. Introduction The shift from hunter-gatherers to agrarian societies has favored the spread of infectious diseases in the human population (Dobson and Carper, 1996). Expanded trades between communities have increased interactions between humans and animals and facilitated the transmission of zoonotic pathogens. Thereafter, expanded cities, extended trade territories, increased travels as well as effects on ecosystems due to increased human population raised the emergence and spread of infectious diseases leading to higher risks for outbreaks, epidemics and even pandemics (Lindahl and Grace, 2015). The terms endemic, outbreak, epidemic and pandemic relate to the occurrence of a health condition compared to its predicted rate as well as to its spread in geographic areas . An endemic condition occurs at a predictable rate among a population. An outbreak corresponds to an unpredicted increase in the number of people presenting a health condition or in the occurrence of cases in a new area. An epidemic is an outbreak that spreads to larger geographic areas. A pandemic is an epidemic that spreads globally. An emerging infection newly appears in a population or is spread in a new geographic area (Morens et al., 2004). The zoonotic transmission of pathogens from animals to humans is a pivotal mechanism by which emerging infections have afflicted humans throughout history (Wolfe et al., 2007). The probability of cross-species transmission of pathogens was dramatically enhanced with increased interactions with animals through hunting, animal farming, trade of animal-based foods, wet markets or exotic pet trade (Bengis et al., 2004). The process of cross-species transmission of pathogens involves 5 different stages (Wolfe et al., 2007). (1) the pathogen exclusively infects animals under natural conditions; (2) the pathogen evolves so that it can be transmitted to humans but without sustained human-to-human transmission; (3) the pathogen undergoes only a few cycles of secondary transmission between humans; (4) the disease exists in animals but long sequences of secondary human-to-human transmission occur without the involvement of animal hosts; and (5) the disease occurs exclusively in humans. The animal species that harbor the pathogen, the nature of human interaction with that animal and the frequency of these interactions likely modulate the risk of zoonotic transmission. Furthermore, land use and climate changes are suggested to play important roles in the transmission of pathogens from wildlife to humans (El-Sayed and Kamel, 2020; White and Razgour, 2020). There is thus a need to implement surveillance programs to rapidly detect the emergence of pathogens with a potential for zoonotic transmission at the animal-human interface. Climate changes also influence the transmission of pathogens (e.g., Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile viruses, Borrelia burgdorferi) by expanding the habitats of various common zoonotic disease-carrying vectors (e.g., Aedes albopictus mosquitos, ticks) (Caminade et al., 2019). The emergence of vector-borne pathogens in non-endemic regions often results in explosive epidemics. Land use due to increasing human population also affects the distribution of disease-carrying vectors (Kilpatrick and Randolph, 2012). Control of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens usually requires vector control to reverse the drivers of transmission. Furthermore, the spread of several infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria, cholera) to extended geographic areas are now raising health concerns for a significant proportion of the population (Morens et al., 2004). These diseases show a wider spread as a result of the acquisition of drug resistance, tolerance of mosquito vector to insecticides, poor sanitation, land use and climate changes as well as increased in human mobility and travels (Cutler et al., 2010). Furthermore, outbreaks of cholera in regions where natural disasters occurred such as earthquakes and floods were also reported. Surveillance programs should be also implemented to control the spread of these pathogens from endemic to non-endemic regions. Finally, infectious agents (e.g., Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, variola virus) could be used as bioweapons and could thus constitute threats for humanity (Oliveira et al., 2020). These weapons are based on natural microorganisms or microorganisms that are engineered to be more virulent, highly transmissible or resistant to therapy (Narayanan et al., 2018). The release of these biological weapons is intended to induce diseases in humans or even death. Therefore, governments should establish biowarfare, bioterrorism and biocrime preparedness plans to protect the population. In this paper, we review major pandemics that have afflicted humankind throughout history such as plague, cholera, influenza and coronavirus diseases, the way they were controlled in the past and how these diseases are managed today. Infectious diseases still represent threats for human health as pathogens can spread rapidly through global trade and travels. Global surveillance programs are thus needed to detect and identify pathogens spillover from animals to humans as well as to control water-borne pathogens and vector-borne diseases. Furthermore, effective non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical measures for the prevention and control of these infections are required to limit their dissemination in the human population. Plague Plague is caused by the flea-borne bacteria Yersinia pestis that is responsible of at least three human plague pandemics, the plague of Justinian, the Black Death and the third plague (Table 1) (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). Y. pestis is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, coccobacillus bacteria. Y. pestis is a facultative anaerobic bacteria that is transmitted by fleas associated mainly to rodents and other mammalian hosts (Perry and Fetherston, 1997). Fleas acquire the bacteria by sucking blood from an infected rodent. Bacteria quickly multiply and block the alimentary canal in the gut of the fleas (Bacot and Martin, 1914). The fleas transmit the bacteria to new rodent hosts by regurgitating the clotted blood. Plague manifests in three forms, i.e., bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic, depending on the route of infection . The bubonic form is the most common and results from the bite of an infected flea. Clinical manifestations include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, body pains, weakness, vomiting and nausea followed by painful swollen lymph nodes. The bubonic form is likely to be fatal (50\u201390% of cases). Septicemic plague is rare (10\u201325% of cases) and consists of a progressive bloodstream infection in the absence of lymphadenopathy. The mortality rate is higher in patients with septicemic plague than in those with the bubonic form. Pneumonic plague occurs when the bacteria infects the lungs, either primarily by infectious respiratory droplets or secondarily as a complication of bubonic plague. This form is characterized by a fulminating onset and is rapidly fatal when left untreated. TABLE 1 Table 1. Timeline of the pandemics described in this paper. The Three Pandemics of Plague The plague of Justinian occurred in Egypt and spread throughout the Eastern Roman Empire and its neighbors (Table 1) (Cunha and Cunha, 2008). Between 541 and 543, the plague killed an estimated 100 million people in the Roman Empire and especially in its capital, Constantinople. The highly developed structure of the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of the Justinian plague along its trade and military routes. In contrast, the plague did not affect the less organized barbarian societies outside of Rome\u2019s borders. The high mortality caused by the disease might have contributed to the weakening and eventually to the decline of the Byzantine Empire. After this initial pandemic, intermittent plague outbreaks occurred every 8 to 12 years for two centuries and then disappeared for unknown reasons. The identification of the causative pathogen involved in the death of victims of past pandemics usually relies on ancient DNA techniques aimed to directly extract DNA from skeletal remains. A great advance in paleomicrobiology techniques was the isolation of microbial DNA in dental pulp specimens (Drancourt et al., 1998). Indeed, bacteria are trapped in the dental pulp early in the course of a bacteremia and can be isolated from preserved teeth of victims. Therefore, analysis of the dental pulp is more efficient than bones to accurately identify microbial DNA from rapidly fatal infections that occurred in the past. Corpses of victims of the Justinian plague could be recovered in burial sites. Ancient DNA techniques from dental pulp samples identified Y. pestis as the etiological pathogen responsible for this pandemic (Harbeck et al., 2013). The second plague pandemic, the Black Death, originated in East Asia and swept across Central Asia into Europe through the land and sea trade routes of the medieval Silk Road (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). The second plague pandemic lasted in Europe until the early of the 19th century and killed 200 million people. The lineages of Y. pestis that caused the plague of Justinian and the Black Death were independent emergences into human population (Wagner et al., 2014). The Black Death (1347\u20131351) killed as many as 30% of the European population and was followed by successive waves such as the plague of Milan (1630), the great plague of London (1665\u20131666) and the plague of Marseille (1720\u20131722). It is suggested that the bacteria may have persisted in rodent reservoirs in Europe and periodically re-emerged in the human population (Seifert et al., 2016). Another hypothesis could be that climate-driven outbreaks of Y. pestis in Asian rodent reservoirs were responsible for new waves of plague arriving into Europe through its maritime trade network with Asia (Schmid et al., 2015). The bacteria suddenly disappeared from Europe and this could be possibly related to the extinction of local rodent reservoirs (Spyrou et al., 2016). At that time, there was no effective treatment against plague. Initial institutional responses to disease control began during the Black Death . A sanitary cordon was imposed by armed guards along transit routes and at access points to cities. A separation between healthy and infected persons was accomplished in camps and then in permanent plague hospitals (called lazarettos). Port cities were closed to ships arriving from plague-infected areas. Ships with suspicion of plague were put in quarantine, passengers and crew were isolated in lazarettos and vessels were thoroughly fumigated and retained for 40 days. The Black Death decimated Medieval Europe and had major impacts on its socio-economic development, culture, art, religion and politics (Bramanti et al., 2016). Based on genomic analysis of ancient and recent genomes, it was suggested that a wave of plague may have traveled from Europe to Asia after the Black Death, eventually setting in China and giving rise to the third plague pandemic (Spyrou et al., 2016). The latter plague pandemic originated in the middle of the 19th century in the Yunnan region (China), reached Canton and spread to Hong Kong (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). In 1894, Alexandre Yersin discovered the bacteria, Y. pestis, in specimens of plague patients and dead rats in Hong Kong . The pandemic then reached Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and India via ships. Over the following years, plague became endemic in many countries around the world (Stenseth et al., 2008). The Plague Nowadays Since the 1990\u2019s, plague is classified as a re-emerging infectious disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017a). Between 2010 and 2015, the number of plague cases was estimated at 3,248 with 584 fatalities worldwide, most of them occurring in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru (Glatter and Finkelman, 2020). In September 2017, a large outbreak of plague occurred in Madagascar with 2,417 cases among whom 77% were clinically suspected to have the pneumonic form . The basic reproduction number (R o ) was estimated at 1.73 (Tsuzuki et al., 2017). The case fatality rate was as high as 8.6% . Plague is seasonal in most endemic countries with a well-defined geographic distribution which corresponds to those of the vectors and rodent reservoirs (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Nowadays, plague should be considered as a neglected human threat due to its rapid spread, its high fatality rate without early treatment and its capacity to disrupt social and healthcare systems (Valles et al., 2020). The genetic plasticity of Y. pestis also suggests a potential risk for the emergence of antibiotic resistance (Radnedge et al., 2002). Surveillance and control programs of fleas and animals involved in the life cycle of Y. pestis are required in endemic regions. Individuals should protect themselves against flea bites in regions where plague is present. It is also recommended to avoid contact with infected body fluids and tissues as well as animal carcasses. Public health interventions that can be put in place to prevent or limit plague outbreaks include the killing of fleas with insecticides and, if required, the control of infected rodents; the early isolation of patients, the rapid diagnostic and treatment of infected individuals with antibiotics; the detection and isolation of contacts and the administration of chemoprophylaxis to exposed individuals (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Standard treatments against plague include streptomycin and doxycycline. Alternative drugs consist of gentamicin and fluoroquinolones (Butler, 2014; Yang, 2018). The WHO does not recommend vaccination except for health care workers and laboratory personnel who are highly exposed to the pathogen. Fifty years ago, a plague vaccine based on whole Y. pestis killed with formalin was approved in the United States. This vaccine was effective against bubonic plague but not against the pneumonic form of the disease. Furthermore, this vaccine was associated with a high reactogenicity. As highlighted in the Madagascar outbreak, Y. pestis can be responsible for pneumonic plague in a high number of cases. Furthermore, Y. pestis can be aerosolized for use as a bioweapon. Y. pestis is considered as a category A pathogen as it can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, cause high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impact (Ansari et al., 2020). Therefore, the development of a plague vaccine against the most deadly form of the disease is needed. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug designation to the recombinant F1 and V subunits vaccine (rF1V) that is intended as a prophylactic vaccine for individuals at high-risk of exposure to aerosolized Y. pestis. Several prophylactic and therapeutic plague vaccines are also being developed under the Plague Vaccine Target Product Profile (TPP) established by the WHO in 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018a). Vaccines under development include subunit, bacterial vector-based or viral vector-based vaccines expressing one or several antigens [F1 capsular protein, low calcium response protein V (LcrV), YscF and/or pesticin coagulase] of Y. pestis (Sun and Singh, 2019). Cholera Cholera is an acute often fatal disease of the gastrointestinal tract caused by Vibrio cholerae (Faruque et al., 1998). V. cholerae is a gram-negative and coma-shaped bacteria. V. cholerae is a facultative anaerobe and has a flagellum at one cell pole as well as pili. The bacteria colonizes the small intestine and produces the cholera toxin which is responsible for a rapid and massive loss of body fluids leading to dehydration, hypovolemic shock and death. V. cholerae strains are classified based on their major lipopolysaccharide O antigens into approximately 206 serogroups of which serogroups O1 (consisting of two biotypes known as classical and El Tor) and O139 cause epidemic cholera (Chatterjee and Chaudhuri, 2006). V. cholerae is a water-borne pathogen. Humans are infected through contaminated water used for drinking or preparing foods. The infection is often mild or asymptomatic and bacteria are eliminated with feces in 1 or 2 weeks. V. cholerae persists indefinitely in aquatic reservoirs and may acquire mobile elements via horizontal gene transfer leading to the emergence of new toxigenic clones (Cho et al., 2010). V. cholerae are able to form a three-dimensional biofilm where the organisms can survive during inter-epidemic periods (Alam et al., 2007). Optimal growth conditions of bacteria in aquatic reservoirs include 15% salinity, 30\u00b0C water temperature and pH 8.5 that can be promoted by climate changes (Montilla et al., 1996). The Seven Cholera Pandemics Cholera was endemic in Asia until 1817, when a first pandemic spread from India to several other regions of the world (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). This pandemic emerged during a period of increasing globalization resulting from technological progress in transportation. Indeed, the advent of steamships and railways allowed a dramatic decrease in travel time and a rise in trade. At that time, health prevention strategies were essentially the same than those implemented during the Black Death . Infected persons were isolated in lazarettos. Port entry was forbidden for ships arriving from regions where cholera was present. Travelers who had contacts with infected persons or who came from a place where cholera was circulating were quarantined. Thereafter, five additional major pandemics of cholera that originated from India and spread to other continents occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). The second and sixth pandemics, and presumably the other ones, were caused by the O1 classical biotype of V. cholerae (Devault et al., 2014; Siddique and Cash, 2014). The second pandemic of cholera reached the British islands. During the cholera outbreak in Soho (London), in 1854, the physician John Snow used for the first time epidemiological methods to trace the source of the outbreak. He described the time course of the outbreak and its geographical spread in the city. He identified the public pumps used for water supply in these areas and understood that water was the source of the contamination. He then proposed effective measures to prevent the transmission through the removal of pump handle in the city areas where the outbreak occurred . The bacillus of cholera was isolated during the fifth pandemic that extensively affected South America by Robert Koch (1884) who also understood the importance of clean water in preventing its transmission. The toxin responsible for the disease was only discovered in 1959 . The seventh cholera pandemic is the most extensive in terms of geographic spread and duration (Mutreja et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2016). It began in Indonesia in 1961 and became endemic in many regions of the world. It periodically caused major epidemics such as those in Zimbabwe (2008), Haiti (2010), Sierra Leone (2012), Mexico (2013), South Soudan and Ghana (2014) and Yemen (2016). Cholera epidemics usually ended because of a lack of favorable environmental conditions for the survival of vibrios. The seventh cholera pandemic was caused by El Tor biotype strain of V. cholerae that acquired virulence genes in the environment (Safa et al., 2010). In late 1992, the O139 serogroup caused a large cholera outbreak in Bangladesh and neighboring countries and raised the fear of a 8th cholera pandemic (Albert et al., 1993). Cholera Nowadays Cholera cannot be eradicated as it is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems. V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 are responsible for cholera outbreaks in developing countries. In 2019, 923,037 cases and 1,911 deaths were reported to WHO in 31 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020d). However, it is estimated that the global burden of cholera is higher due to underreporting. Between 2008 and 2012, the number of cases was shown to range between 1.3 and 4 millions per year with 95,000 deaths (Ali et al., 2015). Environmental and climate changes may increase the geographical distribution of cholera (Chowdhury et al., 2017). Furthermore, the emergence of environmental non-O1/O139 V. cholerae is increasing as genetic exchange mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer and genetic recombination are favored by changes in ecosystem and climate (Vezzulli et al., 2020). These non-O1/O139 vibrios can cause illness that can be mild (e.g., gastroenteritis, otitis) to life-threatening (necrotizing fasciitis) and could thus constitute a potential threat for humans. The persistence of cholera is related to poor living conditions including shortage of safe drinking water, insufficient sanitation, crowded housing and the lack of efficient sewage systems. Re-emergence of the disease can also occur following natural disasters such as earthquakes that disrupt access to safe water supply. Cholera outbreaks could be predicted based on real-time monitoring of oceanic regions, climate fluctuations and epidemiological surveillance program (Chowdhury et al., 2017). The disease could be prevented by implementation of public health measures to ensure adequate sanitation and safe water supply (Somboonwit et al., 2017). The access to safe drinking water and sanitation are among the primary priorities of the Millenium Development Goals and the sustainable Development Goals (Igere and Ekundayo, 2020). Furthermore, the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program launched by the WHO is central to the prevention of cholera transmission (Wolfe et al., 2018). Currently, three oral cholera vaccines were pre-qualified by the WHO (Dukoral\u00ae, SancholTM and Euvochol-Plus\u00ae). These vaccines should be used in areas with endemic cholera, cholera outbreaks and humanitarian crisis with high-risk of cholera in combination with other cholera prevention and control measures (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). Cholera is first identified based on clinical symptoms of severe acute watery diarrhea. The disease is then confirmed by the detection of V. cholerae in stool samples by culture, molecular testing or rapid diagnostic tests. The majority of infected individuals can be treated by the administration of prompt oral rehydration solution. Severely dehydrated patients who are at risk of shock require rapid administration of intravenous fluids as well as antibiotics. First-line drug consists of doxycycline whereas alternative treatments include tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin (Hsueh and Waters, 2019). Influenza Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001). Their genome consists of 7 or 8 RNA segments encoding at least 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Structural proteins include a hemagglutinin (HA), a neuraminidase (NA), two matrix proteins and a nucleoprotein. Influenza viruses can be distinguished in types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are responsible for outbreaks in tropical regions and seasonal epidemics in temperate regions whereas influenza A viruses are the only ones with a pandemic potential (Lofgren et al., 2007). Indeed, influenza A virus is endemic in a number of species including humans, birds and pigs (Webster et al., 1992). Gene reassortments can thus occur between human and animal influenza A viruses and lead to a new virus subtype which can be pathogenic to humans (Webster et al., 1995). In a typical seasonal epidemics, influenza virus causes 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide (Iuliano et al., 2018). Most typical seasonal influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or classical influenza illness characterized by 4 or 5 days of fever, cough, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness and sometimes upper respiratory tract symptoms . Severe complications can occur especially in infants, elderly and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiac/pulmonary diseases. Among the most severe complications is pneumonia which can be associated with secondary bacterial infection. Annual influenza epidemics are sustained in the human population through mutations occurring especially in the HA and NA viral surface glycoproteins, the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. Seasonal influenza virus results from frequent antigenic drifts every 2\u20135 years in response to selection pressure to evade human immunity (Kim et al., 2018). Its genome contains segmented genes which may undergo reassortments in cells co-infected with two or more influenza viruses. Each influenza A virus has a gene encoding for 1 of 16 possible HAs and another gene encoding for 1 of 9 possible NAs that are involved in viral attachment and release, respectively (Dugan et al., 2008). Of the 144 total combinatorial possibilities, only 3 HAs and 3 NAs in only 4 combinations (A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and possibly A/H3N8) were found to be truly adapted to humans. Rarely, antigenic shift which results from reassortment between human and animal viruses leads to the emergence of a new virus subtype (Webster et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2009). This antigenically distinct virus may have the ability to infect humans and achieve sustained human-to-human transmission and may cause a pandemic if the immunity in the human population is partial or lacking (Webster et al., 1992). Influenza Pandemics The time in which influenza virus began to infect humans or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but many historians agree that the first influenza pandemic could have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian flu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the first well-described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet (Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide (Table 1). The median R o was estimated at 2.1 (interquartile range 1.9\u20132.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010). The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range 45\u201370%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in individuals aged 1\u201360 years and lower in infants and seniors (Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age (Valtat et al., 2011). Twenty five years later, the Spanish flu was caused by an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic adaptation of an existing avian influenza virus to a new human host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identification, the virus spread silently around the world and its region of origin could not be determined. Analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from that time confirmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 influenza virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25\u201333% and the R o was estimated at 2\u20133 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918\u20131919 pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month interval. The first wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918\u20131919 caused high mortality. The 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic influenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918\u20131919 pandemic showed a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young adults aged 20\u201340 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007) often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that the 1918 influenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis that was observed in 10\u201315% of cases . The H1 hemagglutinin of the 1918\u20131919 pandemic virus was identified as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a strong pro-inflammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths occurred from several days to weeks (median 7\u201310 days) after the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and social distancing. However, these measures were implemented too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I. Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated the spread of the disease. Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus were the cause of almost all seasonal influenza A epidemics worldwide. All influenza A viruses responsible for the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human, avian and swine influenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown in Figure 1. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Timeline of influenza pandemics caused by the 1918 H1N1 virus and its descendants produced by reassortment of circulating strains with avian influenza viruses (AIV) and swine H1N1 viruses. The reassortment of genes is shown in parenthesis. The re-emergence of H1N1 virus in 1977 is also shown as it co-circulated with the H3N2 virus before being replaced by the H1N1pdm09. HA, hemagglutinin; NA, neuraminidase; NP, nucleoprotein; M, matrix proteins, PB1 polymerase; PB2 polymerase; PA polymerase; NS, non-structural proteins. The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957\u20131959 pandemic (Asian flu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase) by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the 1957\u20131959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case fatality rate was approximately 0.13% . The global mortality of the 1957\u20131959 influenza pandemic was estimated at 1\u20132 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases (Viboud et al., 2016). The R o was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile range 1.53\u20131.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The highest attack rates were in school-age children through young adults up to 35 or 40 years of age (Serfling et al., 1967). Older adults, including those over the age of 60, had significantly lower attack rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults. Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation of the basal layer, limited inflammatory response and evidence of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al., 1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic agent had been identified (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In 1952, the WHO had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided information on the emergence and spread of the novel influenza virus. Containment measures (such as closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for a few weeks only. Influenza vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 53\u201360%) failed to have a significant impact on the pandemic due to inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009). The 1968\u20131970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989). The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that circulated in the human population since 1957. The global mortality rate of the 1968\u20131970 pandemic (Hong Kong flu) was estimated to be 0.5\u20132 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The R o was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56\u20131.85) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62\u201365 years. The first pandemic season was more severe than the second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968\u20131970 influenza pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age groups and to the HA in the elderly. No specific containment measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977, a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978). The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant made of influenza genes originating from human A/H3N2 (PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1, nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011). The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans, it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the population may be important to prevent future pandemics (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka, 2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed (Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The R o was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30\u20131.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-confirmed deaths. However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between 148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case fatality rate based on confirmed cases was 0.5% . Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at 0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality rates in younger populations affecting children, young adults and pregnant women were higher than in a typical influenza season. The average age of people who died with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009 pandemic was the first one to combine vaccines and antiviral use. Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine was approved only during the second wave, the immunization program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010). The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the influenza A/H3N2 continued to circulate. Overall, the impacts of an influenza pandemic depend on the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age and past exposure to influenza viruses. The impacts of influenza are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics (Simonsen et al., 1998). Avian Influenza and the Risks for a New Pandemic The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between influenza viruses in different species, including at the animal-human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported . This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases of human infections with avian influenza viruses also occurred with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al., 2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal influenza viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of influenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby complicating early detection and efficient control of potential outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent and control zoonotic influenza virus infections. Animal facilities must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness. To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9 influenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype of influenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019). Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2 virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the majority of the population has no protective immunity against the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010). Coronaviruses Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019). SARS-CoV Epidemic SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002\u20132003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33\u201342% whereas rates of 22\u201339% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20\u201330% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The R o of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6\u201311 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission . Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013). MERS-CoV Epidemic Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13\u201321% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25\u201350% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50\u201389% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The R o of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea. MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now. SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60\u201390% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14\u201319% of patients are hospitalized and 3\u20135% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29\u201391% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15\u201320% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20\u201349 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50\u201369 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The R o is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e). Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020). How to Prevent a Future Pandemic? Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health. In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O\u2019Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed. The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014). Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020). Concluding Remarks The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.

                "text": "The first satellites Although Soviet plans to orbit a satellite during the IGY had been discussed extensively in technical circles, the October 4, 1957, launch of Sputnik 1 came as a surprise, and even a shock, to most people. Prior to the launch, skepticism had been widespread about the U.S.S.R.\u2019s technical capabilities to develop both a sophisticated scientific satellite and a rocket powerful enough to put it into orbit. Under Korolyov\u2019s direction, however, the Soviet Union had been building an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), with engines designed by Glushko, that was capable of delivering a heavy nuclear warhead to American targets. That ICBM, called the R-7 or Semyorka (\u201cNumber 7\u201d), was first successfully tested on August 21, 1957, which cleared the way for its use to launch a satellite. Fearing that development of the elaborate scientific satellite intended as the Soviet IGY contribution would keep the U.S.S.R. from being the first into space, Korolyov and his associates, particularly Tikhonravov, designed a much simpler 83.6-kg (184.3-pound) sphere carrying only two radio transmitters and four antennas. After the success of the R-7 in August, that satellite was rushed into production and became Sputnik 1. A second, larger satellite carrying scientific instruments and the dog Laika, the first living creature in orbit, was launched November 3. The even larger, instrumented spacecraft originally intended to be the first Soviet satellite went into orbit in May 1958 as Sputnik 3. (For additional information on Korolyov\u2019s contribution to the Soviet space program, see Energia.) After President Eisenhower, in May 1955, had committed the United States to an IGY satellite, the army, navy, and air force competed for the assignment. (No civilian organization existed that was capable of developing the launch vehicle needed.) The mission was assigned to the Naval Research Laboratory rather than to the army\u2019s Redstone Arsenal, where Braun worked, so that the work would not interfere with Redstone\u2019s higher-priority development of ballistic missiles. The navy project, called Vanguard, would use a new launch vehicle based on modified Viking and Aerobee sounding rockets to orbit a small scientific satellite. Vanguard made slow progress over the subsequent two years, but, after Sputnik\u2019s success, the White House pressed to have the satellite launched as quickly as possible. On December 6, 1957, the Vanguard rocket rose only slightly off its launch pad before exploding and sending the satellite not into orbit but onto a Florida beach. Braun and his army superiors had not agreed with the decision to assign the satellite mission to the navy. After the launches of the first two Sputniks, they secured permission to attempt their own satellite launch. In anticipation of such a situation, they had kept in touch with JPL and Van Allen and so were able to prepare a satellite quickly. On January 31, 1958, Braun\u2019s Jupiter-C launch vehicle, a modified Redstone ballistic missile, carried into orbit Explorer 1, the first U.S. satellite. Designed at JPL, Explorer 1 carried Van Allen\u2019s experiment to measure cosmic rays. The results from this experiment and similar ones aboard other U.S. and Soviet satellites launched that same year revealed that Earth is surrounded by two zones of radiation, now known as the Van Allen radiation belts, comprising energetic particles trapped by Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Initial satellite launches were scientific in character, but U.S. government interest in reconnaissance satellites persisted. In February 1958, President Eisenhower authorized the development, under conditions of great secrecy, of such a spacecraft. The project, which came to be called Corona, would take pictures over the Soviet Union and return them to Earth by dropping the exposed film in a capsule that would be snatched out of the air as it parachuted back from space. After 12 failures, the first successful Corona mission took place on August 18, 1960; the returned film contained images of many previously unknown Soviet airfields and missile sites."

                "text": "Peak performance experts say things like, \u201cYou should focus. You need to eliminate the distractions. Commit to one thing and become great at that thing.\u201d This is good advice. The more I study successful people from all walks of life\u2014artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, scientists\u2014the more I believe focus is a core factor of success. But there is a problem with this advice too. Of the many options in front of you, how do you know what to focus on? How do you know where to direct your energy and attention? How do you determine the one thing that you should commit to doing? I don\u2019t claim to have all the answers, but let me share what I\u2019ve learned so far. \u201cUntil Something Comes Easily\u2026\u201d Like most entrepreneurs, I struggled through my first year of building a business. I launched my first product without having any idea who I would sell it to. (Big surprise, nobody bought it.) I reached out to important people, mismanaged expectations, made stupid mistakes, and essentially ruined the chance to build good relationships with people I respected. I attempted to teach myself how to code, made one change to my website, and deleted everything I had done during the previous three months. To put it simply, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. During my Year of Many Errors I received a good piece of advice: \u201cTry things until something comes easily.\u201d I took the advice to heart and tried four or five different business ideas over the next 18 months. I\u2019d give each one a shot for two or three months, mix in a little bit of freelance work so I could continue scraping by and paying the bills, and repeat the process. Eventually, I found \u201csomething that came easily\u201d and I was able to focus on building one business rather than trying to find an idea. In other words, I was able to simplify. This was the first thing I discovered about figuring out what to focus on. If you want to master and deeply understand the core fundamentals of a task you may, paradoxically, need to start by casting a very wide net. By trying many different things, you can get a sense of what comes more easily to you and set yourself up for success. It is much easier to focus on something that\u2019s working than struggle along with a bad idea. Make a Call About What to Focus On Assuming you\u2019re willing to try things and experiment a bit, the next question is, \u201cHow do I know what\u2019s coming easily to me?\u201d The best answer I can give is to pay attention. Usually, this means measuring something. If you\u2019re an entrepreneur, track your marketing and promotion efforts. If you\u2019re trying to gain muscle, track your workouts. If you\u2019re learning an instrument, track your practice sessions. Even when you do measure things, however, there comes a point where you have to make a call and decide what to focus on. In my mind, this moment of decision is one of the central tensions of entrepreneurship. Do we continue trying new things or do we double down on one strategy? Do we try to innovate or do we commit to doing one thing well? Everyone wants to know the right time to simplify and focus on one thing, but nobody does. That\u2019s what makes success so hard. Entrepreneurship isn\u2019t like baking a cake. There is no recipe. There is no guidebook. 1 At this stage, your best option is to decide. You can\u2019t try everything. At some point, you don\u2019t need more information, you just need to make a choice. A Volume of Work Now we have reached the stage where figuring out what to focus on becomes a real possibility. You have experimented with enough ideas to discover one or two options that seem to provide better than average results for you. You\u2019ve overcome the hurdle of wanting more information and the fear of committing to something and now you\u2019ve made a choice. You took the job. You started the business. You signed up for the class. You\u2019re ready. Welcome to the grind. It\u2019s time to put in a volume of work. Not just once or twice. Not just when it\u2019s easy. But a consistent, repeated volume of work. You have to fall in love with boredom and stay on the bus. It is through this sheer number of repetitions that you\u2019ll come to understand the fundamentals of your task. You might know what greatness looks like before this point, but you won\u2019t understand how to achieve greatness until you\u2019ve put the work in yourself. In the words of Ira Glass, \u201cyour taste is good enough that you can tell that what you\u2019re making is kind of a disappointment to you.\u201d You\u2019ll bridge that gap between what you know is good and what you can produce yourself by putting in the reps. This applies to so many areas of life. Want to dress well and develop killer style? You\u2019re going to have to try on a lot of clothes before you can simplify down to the essentials. You\u2019ll probably have to buy a lot of clothes before you can really get a feel for what your day-in, day-out style is. I\u2019m not a fan of promoting rampant consumerism, but if that\u2019s the skill set you want to develop then it\u2019s likely going to take some experimentation and effort. Want to become a great cook? How many bad meals do you think you need to make before you can whip up a \u201csimple, but tasty dinner\u201d whenever you feel like it? I\u2019d say hundreds at least. I don\u2019t know many people who are amazing cooks after making their tenth meal ever. Developing a deep understanding of the fundamentals of cooking takes a while. Want to write an amazing book? You\u2019re going to have to write and write and write some more. You need to write hundreds of thousands of words to find your voice, maybe millions. Then you need to edit those words and whittle them down to the most powerful version possible. Only after the repetitions have been completed will you understand which pieces of the task are fundamental to success. Getting to Simple Now, finally, after trying many things and figuring out what to focus on and putting in enough reps, you can begin to simplify. You can trim away the fat because you know what is essential and what is unnecessary. As the Frenchman Blaise Pascal famously wrote in his Provincial Letters, \u201cIf I had more time, I would have written you a shorter letter.\u201d Mastering the fundamentals is often the hardest and longest journey of all."

Coca Cola\u2019s logo largely remained the same till the 1950s when a new fishtail logo was introduced. The logo went along for about a decade and was later given up to adopt the new logo in the 1960s, much similar to the modern logo. Also, Coca Cola\u2019s much recognized red and white colour combination was also introduced in the 1950s. In the 1960s logo, the wave was also introduced, which stayed around for quite a while and had become a major part of recognition for the brand. This logo was kept the same for more than two decades until 1985 when Coca Cola introduced their product in a redefined way under the name of New Coke and changed their logo to more formal and simpler fonts. The consumers didn\u2019t react very positively to this redefinition of the brand and the brand later decided to go back to their old logo only a couple of years later. The logo of Coca Cola introduced in the year 1987 was strikingly similar to the logo introduced in the 1960s except that in this logo, the wave was reintroduced and the name was \u2018Coca Cola Coke\u2019. In the 1990s, moving with the times, the brand introduced the logo with a more gradient and gloss with a pattern of water droplets on it. This logo too didn\u2019t stay long and was given up in the early years of the 21st century to introduce the Coca Cola Classic logo which is almost identical to the 1960s logo. The final logo was introduced by the brand in the year 2009 in their iconic red colour much similar to their 1940s logo."

                "heading": "Third World Countries: Definition, Criteria, and Countries",
                "text": "What Is the Third World? \"Third World\" is an outdated and derogatory phrase that has been used historically to describe a class of economically developing nations. It is part of a four-part segmentation that was used to describe the world\u2019s economies by economic status. Third World falls behind First World and Second World but was ahead of Fourth World, though Fourth-World countries were hardly recognized at all. Today, the preferred terminology is a developing nation, an underdeveloped country, or a low- and middle-income country (LMIC). Defining Developing Nations There can be a few ways to divide up the world for purposes of economic segmentation. Classifying countries as First, Second, Third, and Fourth World was a concept created during and after the Cold War, which ran from approximately 1945 to the 1990s. In general, nations are typically characterized by economic status and key economic metrics like gross domestic product (GDP), GDP growth, GDP per capita, employment growth, and an unemployment rate. In developing countries, low production rates and struggling labor market characteristics are usually paired with relatively low levels of education, poor infrastructure, improper sanitation, limited access to health care, and lower costs of living. Developing nations are closely watched by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which seek to provide global aid for the purposes of projects that help to improve infrastructure and economic systems comprehensively. Both organizations refer to these countries as lower-middle or low-income countries. Developing nations, or LMIC, can be the target of many investors seeking to identify potentially high returns through possible growth opportunities, though risks are also relatively higher. While developing countries are generally characterized as performing poorer economically, innovative and industrial breakthroughs can lead to substantial improvements in a short amount of time. Key Takeaways A Third World country is an outdated and offensive term for a developing nation characterized by a population with low and middle incomes, and other socio-economic indicators. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization allow for certain benefits and contractual term provisions for countries that meet certain types of economic status classifications. History of Developing Nations Classifications The classification of nations as First World or Third World emerged during and after the Cold War. First-World countries were known as the most highly industrialized nations whose views aligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and capitalism. Second-World countries supported communism and the Soviet Union. Most of these countries were formerly controlled by the Soviet Union. Many countries of East Asia also fit into the Second-World category. Third-World countries included nations in Asia and Africa that were not aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Now, in part because the Soviet Union no longer exists, the definition of Third World is outdated and may be considered offensive to many. Alfred Sauvy Coined the Term Alfred Sauvy, a French demographer, anthropologist, and historian, is credited with coining the term Third World during the Cold War. Sauvy observed a group of countries, many former colonies, that did not share the ideological views of Western capitalism or Soviet socialism. \"Three worlds, one planet,\" wrote Sauvy in a 1952 article published in L'Observateur.\ufeff\ufeff Dividing the World In the modern-day, most countries on Earth fall into one of three general categories that some refer to as developed, emerging, and frontier. The world segmentations have somewhat migrated to fit within these categories overall. The developed countries are the most industrialized with the strongest economic characteristics. The emerging countries are classified as such because they demonstrate significant strides in various economic growth areas though their metrics are not as stable. The frontier markets often closely mirror the old Third-World classification and often show the lowest economical indicators. Frontier Markets List The evolutions of the worldly segmentations have become historic and obsolete. As such, one barometer for assessing a list of developing countries is MSCI\u2019s Frontier Markets Index. This index includes the following countries: Croatia Estonia Iceland Lithuania Kazakhstan Romania Serbia Slovenia Kenya Mauritius Morocco Nigeria Tunisia WAEMU Bahrain Jordan Oman Bangladesh Pakistan Sri Lanka Vietnam Other Definitions of Developing Nations The World Trade Organization (WTO), also provides another point of reference. The WTO divides countries into two classes: developing and least developed. There are no criteria for these classifications so countries self-nominate, though statuses can be contested by other nations. The WTO segregation comes with certain rights for developing country status. For example, the WTO grants developing countries longer transition periods before implementing agreements that aim to increase trading opportunities and infrastructure support related to WTO work. As an offshoot of the WTO, the Human Development Index (HDI) is another economic status metric developed by the United Nations to assess the social and economic development levels of countries. The HDI measures and then ranks a country based on schooling, life expectancy, and gross national income per capita. The World Health Organization and the United Nations uses Least Developed Countries (LDC) to describe a set of 48 countries with low socioeconomic developmental indicators. This list is reassessed every few years. These indicators are a combination of gross national income, human assets (nutrition, life expectancy, secondary school education, adult literacy), and economic vulnerability (population size, remoteness, merchandise export concentration, agriculture, exports, and natural disaster preparedness)."

                "heading": "10 Ways The Internet Has Changed The Way We Live (And Do Business)",
                "text": "The full-length title of this article should be 10 ways the Internet and the smartphone have changed the way we live - as humans and customers - and how businesses must evolve to improve their customer experience and survive the digital transformation. We all recognize mobile technology as the real game-changer in the creation of the world as we experience it today. The hidden truth, though, is that there would be no smartphone without the Internet revolution. We are the result of this revolution. Can you imagine your life without the Internet? We can start with one simple question: Can you imagine your life without the Internet? Just close your eyes for a moment and think about what life was before the web. You can barely remember that time if you were born and grew up before the Internet. If you are a digital native, this task is simply impossible. Millennials - also known as digital customers - will never experience a world with no connectivity and mobile devices. Yes, there are still (small) areas of our planet not wired and cabled but - at least for us living in developed countries - it is hard to imagine a life before Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook. If you search on Google (where else!), you will find tons of experiments or researches about life without the Internet. They all come down to one single definitive truth: \"I cannot even imagine my life without the Internet or the smartphone. It is an integral part of who I am.\" (Gallup) The Internet is still relatively young (it just celebrated its 32th birthday in 2021) and yet the connectivity has already produced long-lasting effects. It all started with a cable plugged into the phone line, and now we possess the entire world in the palm of our hand. There is one exact moment that changed things forever, and that was when the Internet came out of our home, held inside a small box called smartphone. According to the \"Worldwide digital population as of January 2021\" by Joseph Johnson, we have reached 4.66 billion connected people in the world. In other words, almost 59.5% of the worldwide population is now online, at home and on mobile devices. Every single activity of our daily life is influenced by connected existence: More than 50 million pieces of content are shared every day; More than 1 billion websites are online; More than 500 million Tweets are sent every day, More than 50 billion pieces of content are shared on Facebook each month; More than 15 billion items have been sold on Amazon in 2021, with 40% of those sold by third-party sellers. What is true for people is, even more, true for organizations. The way you do business today is completely different from the best practices taken for granted only a decade ago. All certainties suddenly disappeared, washed away from a stream of connectivity. The Internet has brought treats but also huge opportunities, for those able to respond timely and unlock the power of emerging technologies. The years pass by, but the rules of the competition remain the same: you succeed only if you can understand what is going on, if you adapt to the evolution of technology and behaviors, and if you answer to the unprecedented demands of new customers. Business and technology go hand in hand, and so does the customer experience. Any analysis of how life has changed may look like a trip down memory lane, but it also helps you understand where we are all headed for as human beings, customers, and organizations. So, here are the 10 ways the Internet has changed (and will keep changing) the way we live. The 10 ways the Internet has changed the way we live RESEARCH Where do you go when you are collecting information about a product or looking for an answer? Google, of course. The Internet has become the primary source of information, and search engines the main door to access it. Thanks to the smartphone, you have the complete knowledge in your pocket. Education, essays, product comparison, self-improvement tips, technical details, diets, do it yourself, lolcats, the Internet has it all. If you are a brand, you need to be there with meaningful contents. COMMUNICATION Do you still remember phone calls and letters? We have witnessed a complex evolution in the way we connect with other people and with companies. First came the chat rooms and forums, then - especially after the spread of smartphones - social networks and online communities. Face to face communication is still important but we increasingly rely on wide circles of strangers to decide what to do and what to buy. In the mobile era, communication is about building networks. SHOPPING The success of Amazon, eBay, and online marketplaces says that visiting the physical location of a store is no longer mandatory if you want to make a purchase. Shopping for a particular item looks like a journey across channels: you can see a product in the store, search for information online, compare prices between retailers, make the purchase in-app and pick it up at the store. The disruption of the retail industry always implies the renovation of the retail customer experience. TRAVELS Not so long ago, the essence of travel was the idea of discovery. Is it still? Today, you can know everything about a place even before leaving home. And planning has never been so easy and cheap: You have websites for information, mobile apps for real-time discount and offers, virtual reality for a full 3D immersion. Even when you are there, mobile technology is there for you: Uber for affordable transfers, Airbnb for cheap stays, Google Maps to find the way, TripAdvisors for gourmet restaurants. Who needs travel agencies anymore? ENTERTAINMENT Remember when you had to visit the video store to rent a VHS, hoping that the movie you were looking for was not taken already? That is the past. With the Internet, you have everything you need in one place, and rarely you need something physical (i.e. a Dvd) to enjoy it. With the emergence of smart TVs and the new generation of gaming consoles, all you need is a connection, be it movie streaming (Netflix), music (Spotify), the sports experience or on-demand personalized contents. FINANCIAL SERVICES Once upon a time, people had to visit the bank to check the most basic financial operations. That was before the dawn of online banking, before the disintermediation. Before the \u2018Uberization\u2019 of retail banking. Technology trends have forced traditional institutions to face the challenge of evolution, transforming generic accounts into actual human beings. What they must do now is to stop focusing on products and money and start caring about the retail banking customer experience. In the name of innovation (mobile wallets, one-touch payments) and personalization. RELATIONSHIPS You do not need to know someone to love him/her. You do not need to feel the pressure of playing all your cards in a few minutes while waiting for the bus. Now you can find the love your life - or at least meet new friends - by simply downloading an app and filling out a profile. Be it dating or building professional relationships, there is a place for you online. This evolution has consequences for businesses: people now rely on a wider circle of trust, other people they barely know that can influence their decisions, one way or another. HEALTHCARE In the Internet age, everyone is a doctor. While you should not trust what you read online, when you feel symptoms of some sort, it is undeniable that technology has changed the medical experience and the relationship between doctors and patients. On the one hand we have the risk of misleading information; on the other hand, the emerging awareness that mobile devices can improve the quality of life and help prevent diseases. Wearables technology is the main driver of the self-tracking obsession; connected with health platforms (HealthKit), they will shape the future of healthcare. MARKETING When the way we communicate changes, marketing techniques change accordingly. If you try to employ traditional marketing ideas to today\u2019s world, you will soon recognize they are outdated and inefficient. The reason is simple: customers have changed, their purchase behavior have changed. Even when they are in the store, they go online to compare products. The success of proximity marketing is due to the need (for companies) to engage customers with context aware contents, and delight them with meaningful and personalized experiences. EMPLOYMENT Do you really need to spend eight hours a day in the office to be productive? Twenty years ago, this questions made no sense at all. Of course, you needed to be there. Today things are different, and it is all about the Internet. The evolution of web-based tools and the growth of cloud services have made the physical co-presence unnecessary. We live and work in an ecosystem of constant connectivity, and this is bringing employers and governments to a complete change of perspective, in the name of flexibility. To improve quality of life and cut inefficiency. Now it is your turn. Tell us how the Internet has changed the way you live and do business. For every need you have, for every challenge you are facing, Neosperience has a suitable solution for your company. Select your goal and tell us how we can help you!

                "text": "We are all equal children before our mother; and India asks each one of us, in whatsoever role we play in the complex drama of nation-building, to do our duty with integrity, commitment and unflinching loyalty to the values enshrined in our Constitution. Pranab Mukherjee, Former President of India What is a nation and what does the word mean according to an individual? What constitutes a nation? These are some of the questions that need to be answered before understanding the concept of nation-building. Although the generally accepted definition of a \u2018Nation\u2019 does not exist, a nation can be defined as a structure, built and modified by its people to elucidate the identity of a political community in ever-evolving circumstances. This structure which is considered to be a blend of both old and new traditional elements and innovations plays a significant role in producing a contextual story of \u2018we\u2019. A nation is considered as a named human population who have been sharing a territory since historic times, common traditions and myths with some historical memories, public culture and an economy, legal rights and duties in common for all members of a nation. Benedict Anderson who defined a nation as \u2018an imagined political community\u2019, referred this notion of imagined community as a community of people staying connected to each other with a sense of belonging and without necessarily knowing each other. Every country or community is made of citizens, and the strength or weakness of the country or community depends on the character of the citizens. Olakunle Agboola Concept of Nation Building and Citizenship Nation-building is an old term and was one of the key concept of the foreign, overseas, security and development policy during the 1950s and 1960s. But in today\u2019s world, it is popularly known as a process which sets in motion the socio-political development of a country by bonding loosely associated societies into a common community of one identity under the concept of Nation. Therefore, the basic purpose and objective of nation-building is to bring unity among the people of a country so that the political viability of a country can sustain for a long period of time. But according to economists, the concept of nation-building has always been the process of creating a properly functioning country out of the one that is not, which basically means to transform a collapsed country that was either destroyed in a war or never functioned as a country in the first place into a country having a legitimately functioning government and effective social institutions with credible currency and a well-functioning economy. Citizens of a country who are considered as the legal members of a nation act as one of the dominant pillars in the process of building a nation. Dynamic co-operation from every individual citizen acts as a major contribution towards this multidimensional concept of nation-building. This concept of citizenship which has obtained a whole new meaning in this current democratic world majorly emphasizes on the duties and responsibilities of citizens towards one\u2019s own country. Each citizen has to fulfil various duties like paying his taxes, exercise his right of vote, discourage corruption by discouraging bribing, educate people and follow the rules and regulations as a responsible citizen of this country. Therefore a solid and powerful nation can be built from the dedication and hard work of its citizens and some smart measures and implementations of the Government. There are two basic principles that are followed in today\u2019s world to determine a person\u2019s citizenship, one is inus soli: the principle which considers and classifies people residing and living within the territory of a country as citizens, irrespective of their religion, linguistic roots and ethnicity. Hence living within the boundaries and on the territory of a country has been one of the basic criteria to consider a person as a citizen and bind him with all the legal rights and obligations that are connected to the concept of citizenship. The other one is inus sanguis which entitles the descendants and descending generations of the people who strived to build the country and lived in that territory for ages with citizenship. Duty of Citizens in Nation Building Paying Taxes Paying taxes is the duty and responsibility of each and every citizen towards his/her nation. This duty of citizens plays a significant role in the development of the nation. The then Union Finance Minister of our country, Mr Arun Jaitley had once said that acknowledging taxpayers for paying their taxes within the prescribed time period and timely filing of their income tax returns will aid in bringing about a change in people\u2019s attitude and will drive them in a positive way to pay their taxes on time. This is important because it is a well- known fact that a Nation meets its commitments and obligations towards spending in various social sectors, implementation of various welfare schemes and development of infrastructure through this revenue generated out of taxes paid by millions of tax-paying citizens. Therefore this step which was taken by the Government to communicate directly to the person and appreciated for their contribution contributed majorly in bringing about necessary changes in the behaviour of citizens towards payment of taxes. Paying taxes is the duty and responsibility of each and every citizen towards his/her nation. This duty of citizens plays a significant role in the development of the nation.

Therefore this step which was taken by the Government to communicate directly to the person and appreciated for their contribution contributed majorly in bringing about necessary changes in the behaviour of citizens towards payment of taxes. Exercising Vote as a Citizen India being a democratic country, it is built upon the foundation of elections. Voting is not just a mere right given to an Indian citizen; it is a Constitutional Right. It is through the critical way of voting that an individual takes part in the decisions of Government and in a way influences the decision of the Government. Therefore, it is the duty of every citizen to cast his vote and influence the decisions taken by political heads and bring about changes in the country. At the same time, having a transparent and corruption-free election procedure is a step towards building and developing a nation. Under Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it has been contemplated that it is the right of every citizen to take part in the Government of his/ her country either directly or through freely chosen representatives. The right to equal access to publicly serve his country should be given to every citizen. It has also been stated that the authority of the Government should be based on the will of the people. Discouraging Corruption Corruption is a serious challenge faced by every country. It hinders the nation from growth and development. India\u2019s Prime Minister Mr Modi\u2019s Government has taken many measures in the recent past to eradicate this social evil. Especially the step of demonetization taken by the Modi Government was considered as a long term reform and a perfect step taken towards nation-building. This step of demonetisation was popularly called as \u2018Charitra Nirman\u2018 to encourage and push citizens of the country towards building their character as well in the sense to restrain oneself from engaging in corruption.

Education: Education helps and enables a person to build the right foundation for himself and enables him to take decisions and make choices that will benefit his further life. Today\u2019s children are tomorrow\u2019s citizens is a well-known saying. Therefore knowledge is a weapon that can bring about progress not only to a child\u2019s life but to the entire nation as well. It is only through education that an individual will get an employment opportunity and it is only then that an individual will be in a position to lead a better life. Overall improvement in the living conditions of each individual will contribute towards the overall development of a nation. Hence, education will not only benefit an individual but will also promote the overall progress and improvement of a nation. Conclusion Though there are many ways to build a nation, the contribution of a citizen towards this process of building a nation is unparalleled. Citizens are the greatest source of power for a country. Without citizens, a state or a country is just a piece of land. Every citizen\u2019s dedication will definitely pave the way towards a better nation. We are the soul of a nation and when we strive and perform our duties towards the best interest of our country, only then our country will take a step towards development. Therefore I summarize my words through this quote of Mahatma Gandhi- \u2018The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.\u2018"

                "text": "What is an ecommerce platform? An ecommerce platform is the content management system (CMS) and commerce engine websites use to manage catalogued products, register purchases and manage a users relationship with an online retailer. It doesn't matter if your business is large or small, B2B or B2C, selling tangible goods or providing remote services. Companies need to meet their customers in the right place to increase their sales, and today's customers increasingly want to connect and shop online. According to Statistica, 80% of Americans shopped online in 2020. As of March 2021, Pew Research noted that over 30% of Americans are online \"constantly,\" meaning their attention has shifted away from their physical environment to the virtual world. This statistic is sure to climb in the next few years. Successful companies incorporate ecommerce platforms into their business operations to meet consumers where they are. Key takeaways: Defining an ecommerce platform Why you should choose an ecommerce platform Three different types of ecommerce platforms Four things to consider before selecting your ecommerce platform Defining an ecommerce platform An ecommerce platform is a software solution that allows businesses to centrally manage their virtual assets, omnichannel marketing, digitals sales and operations. Platforms like Optimizely DXP offer powerful, cloud-based shopping features with prebuilt marketing, content, and sales frameworks that integrate seamlessly into existing workflows. Today's successful companies have switched to digital experience platforms (DXP) or agile content management systems (CMS) to centralize their marketing and sales processes. Companies using ecommerce platforms see increased efficiency return on investment (ROI). You have three options for the best ecommerce platform Choosing the proper foundation for your ecommerce website will have a significant impact on your business' growth potential, regardless of pricing. There are only a handful of options for building this kind of customization. Select a proven ecommerce platform. The benefits of existing ecommerce platforms are enormous if you look at some great examples of successful online stores such as Shopify or even Amazon. The best platforms are cloud-based and offer built-in customer personalization. And they scale to your needs --- often making them more affordable than the other options. Build your platform from scratch. This option is more feasible for the largest, most successful companies and yields the most customized functionality. Platforms are expensive to build and can be costly to run. Customized ecommerce platforms also require a trained DevOps team to maintain and upgrade as technology continues to evolve. Use a plugin. CMS plugins may work for tiny businesses or those experimenting with ecommerce, but they are rarely an ideal solution. Plugins are limited in capability and cross-channel integration, and developers can suspend support at any time. Established cloud-based ecommerce platforms such as DXPs and Agile CMSs are the best option for most companies. They allow small- and medium-sized businesses to participate and succeed in the digital landscape and are extensible to every company's needs. The three platforms Assuming an ecommerce platform is the best option for your company, there are three types of platforms to choose from: Open-Source SaaS (software as a service) Headless commerce Open-source ecommerce platform An open-source ecommerce platform allows you to modify and control everything --- across the board. This option is excellent for tech-heavy companies with internal DevOps teams who can easily tweak open-source software to do their bidding. However, it's rarely a solution for small- and medium-sized businesses or those with no development team. Software as a Service ecommerce platform SaaS ecommerce platforms are effective for getting up and running quickly. You don't have to build or maintain software, because you rent your ecommerce platform from a provider. You can still retain some flexibility for your in-house developers, too. A reputable SaaS ecommerce platform will come with an API library, so you can integrate your existing teams' tools to work with the SaaS ecommerce platform. Many allow you to modify and redesign the UX buildouts as well. Such systems are often called open SaaS ecommerce platforms. Headless ecommerce platform Headless ecommerce platforms are also called CaaS platforms. They organize and distribute content as a service (CaaS). Headless platforms decouple the shopping cart from the CMS completely. This decoupling offers several benefits: Platform flexibility -- you won't be tied to a single, monolithic system You can use APIs to set up a separate SaaS shopping cart You are more flexible and open to front-end changes in the future Many companies find that a headless ecommerce platform provides the best of both worlds. First, they control a monolithic, typically cloud-based, storage over their marketing, sales and product assets. Even better, businesses can pick and choose which front-end services to use and easily connect to them using APIs. If companies decide they want to change shopping cart services, they can switch easily, as they aren't tied to a monolithic, front-end and back-end SaaS. Digital experience platforms (DXPs) and Agile CMSs (a form of headless CMS) are two types of headless ecommerce platforms that are gaining popularity among companies of all sizes for their flexibility. Four attributes to consider when choosing an ecommerce platform Picking an ecommerce platform is never easy. When considering your options, you need to keep four specific attributes in mind. 1. Budget for everything you need One mistake many companies make is that they only budget for specific platform tasks without realizing the hidden costs of maintaining or offering ecommerce options. Ecommerce platforms require an investment upfront, and the costs can scale when they start increasing your market share. If you decide to go with an open-source solution, for example, you'll end up paying for all of the following things out-of-pocket at some point -- likely upfront. Use a DXP or SaaS option, and the costs will scale along your growth, which is actually more affordable. Determine costs and your budget for all the following: Web design Platform development and integration Custom app creation Cybersecurity Monthly hosting Maintenance Licensing 2. Target market Remember, the point of ecommerce platforms is to meet your market where they are --- online --- and make sales. You need to find a platform that makes it easy to target market your customers on the channels they use. Omnichannel delivery is crucial. 3. Scalability How easily will a chosen platform scale with your business? Perhaps one option is more affordable at your company's current size and will allow for scalability as you grow. An ecommerce platform that doesn't scale affordably is one you should avoid! 4. Provider's customer service options If you decide to use a SaaS or headless ecommerce platform, choose a company with reliable customer service and maintenance options. If a problem arises, you want to be sure your company gets help to respond to the situation as quickly as possible. Customer service trickles down to your team and customers. Choose a well-known, reputable and proven provider."

                "text": "I would say that film is vital to society. We\u2019ve all watched movies or comedy programs such as The Simpsons, South Park, and Family Guy. Yes, these are fictional shows, but they can be influential to some people. They have pushed the envelope of what is acceptable in television, and many people worldwide love them. But I think film is so vital to society because it gives us a chance to reflect on our own lives and the lives of others who are different and can offer us a new perspective on life. The Impacts of Film on Society Most film lovers are fond of motion pictures, but they may find it challenging to articulate why they\u2019re also so important to society. For the movie lover : there are many reasons why movies are an essential art form, but movie lovers may find it difficult to articulate them in detail. \u201cMovies are just fun to watch on the weekend\u201d doesn\u2019t quite cut it.

For popular culture : today, film is considered one of America\u2019s most popular art forms and perhaps even its most significant contribution to world culture. It\u2019s hard to imagine what our lives would be like without motion pictures \u2013 those flickering images projected on a screen that have become iconic representations of our inner and outer realities, conveying ideas and feelings from one person or culture to another through space and time. : today, film is considered one of America\u2019s most popular art forms and perhaps even its most significant contribution to world culture. It\u2019s hard to imagine what our lives would be like without motion pictures \u2013 those flickering images projected on a screen that have become iconic representations of our inner and outer realities, conveying ideas and feelings from one person or culture to another through space and time. For those working in the film industry, motion pictures have become a significant industry in America and other leading production centers over the last century. They create jobs for thousands of people involved in production, screening, distribution, and other related activities. They indirectly create hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs by creating new markets for staples such as popcorn kernels or celluloid raw material used to print films on reels\u2026 and much more! Movies also create economic opportunities through tourism (think Hollywood Boulevard) that benefit all kinds of people, like hoteliers, restaurateurs, shopkeepers, and so on\u2026 Entertainment and Pleasure For some, it\u2019s simply a matter of entertainment and pleasure. Most people go to the movies to have a good time. They want to be transported to another world for two hours, to forget the stress of their job or other worries. That\u2019s one of the reasons why film is so important as an art form \u2013 it offers people a momentary escape from reality, regardless of what kind of movie they\u2019re watching. Cinema is the most beautiful fraud in the world. Jean-Luc Godard Of course, a film can also captivate an audience in ways that TV and other media cannot. It may sound obvious, but a film can engage the senses at once in a way that no other medium can. The sights and sounds, combined with the experience of being in a darkened movie theater with dozens (or even hundreds) of similarly enthralled viewers, make for an immersive experience that\u2019s quite different from watching TV or playing video games alone at home. Identification and Identity For others, identifying with the characters in the films they see or a fascination with the craftsmanship that makes high-quality movies possible. People love their movies, and for good reason. Movies are the only art form that allows us to identify with the characters on an emotional level. We see them as people struggling with real problems and facing real challenges. We live vicariously through them and find our fears, desires, hopes, and aspirations. Consequently, film can influence public opinion on social issues and change how we perceive ourselves \u2013 and sometimes even how we feel about ourselves. For me, the cinema is not a slice of life, but a piece of cake. Alfred Hitchcock For many of us, film is an escape from the monotony of everyday life; it provides entertainment that makes us laugh or cry (or both!). For others, it\u2019s about being able to identify with the characters in the movies or being fascinated by the craftsmanship that makes movies possible. Some see movies as art, while others enjoy watching actors portray fictional characters living their lives in epic adventure stories or romantic comedies. Even More Effective Today Movies have always changed the world, but they\u2019ve never been as effective as in our time. At the end of the 19th century, the motion picture camera and the projector were invented. The first motion pictures, known as \u201csilent movies,\u201d hit theaters in the 1890s. Not long after, film and television became dominant forces in American popular culture. Film has changed history repeatedly, but it\u2019s never been as influential as it\u2019s today. Movies have always been an effective way to reflect the world around us. Through comedies and dramas, through stories of love, hope, triumph, and tragedy, films show who we\u2019re as people through the lives of the characters on screen \u2013 not just the ones we identify with, but all of them, portrayed by actors who draw us into their world. The best films encourage us to think about ourselves and how we can improve our lives and society; they show us how to better understand one another through compassion and empathy while encouraging critical thinking about how we got here and the direction we\u2019re headed. Movies have always been an effective way to change the world around you because they\u2019re mirrors that give viewers from all walks of life insights into their own lives \u2013 or at least fictionalized versions of them. That\u2019s what makes them entertaining, both for viewers at home (or at the movies) and for those who make these cinematic masterpieces possible behind the scenes at every step of this journey called life. When films about war reflect the real world with gritty realism rather than stylized depictions of soldiers marching into battle under waving flags, they can be used as tools for social change. As you know, film is a potent medium and can be used for social change. When films about war reflect the real world with gritty realism, rather than showing stylized depictions of soldiers marching into battle under waving flags, they can profoundly affect how viewers think about issues of war and peace. For example, the movie Saving Private Ryan depicted the horrors of World War II with gruesome special effects; the opening scene focused on the gruesome deaths of several characters-many viewers couldn\u2019t watch it! In contrast, old-fashioned films often showed patriotic feelings about the war. In Sands of Iwo Jima, for example, John Wayne plays an American soldier who wants to defend his country against enemies. When viewers see realistic depictions of combat on screen, they may be less inclined to support armed conflict to solve problems. This is an excellent example of how movies shape society! Broaden Horizons Films can give viewers a different view of society than they\u2019re used to, broadening their horizons and making them think about problems in new ways. They can offer a different perspective on the lives of people in other societies, providing insight into the lives and cultures of other people. Films can educate us about other societies that are very different from our own. Films can also serve to change the way people think about specific issues. For example, films like An Inconvenient Truth have been used to educate viewers about climate change and move them to action. Art Form and Tool In this way, film is both an art form and a tool for social change. It can entertain, educate, or explore critical social issues. Films can make us sit up and take notice, learn about a new culture, experience a different perspective, or open our eyes to a world we know nothing about. We watch movies because they\u2019re entertaining and make us think about issues in new ways. They don\u2019t just reflect our culture; they change it! Mirrors of Society Movies are essential to society because they reflect culture, change culture, and spur economic growth. Cinema is a reflection of its own society. Shohreh Aghdashloo Movies reflect a culture in so many ways. Think about the messages of your favorite movies and how those messages have influenced you. In this way, film reflects culture. For example, a movie that calls for forgiveness will resonate with people who forgive but not with people who don\u2019t forgive. Movies also change culture by influencing the beliefs, opinions, and behaviors of the people who see them. For example, a documentary about child abuse may move you to take action against child abuse in your community, whether by volunteering for an organization or donating money. This is how films change a culture. by influencing the beliefs, opinions, and behaviors of the people who see them. For example, a documentary about child abuse may move you to take action against child abuse in your community, whether by volunteering for an organization or donating money. This is how films change a culture. Movies promote economic growth by creating jobs for thousands of people from all walks of life and generating billions of dollars in revenue each year that\u2019s returned to the economy through taxes and other expenditures on goods and services related to film production (e.g., construction workers building a set). Some Filmmakers Who Influenced Society Alfred Hitchock Steven Spielberg Walt Disney Martin Scorcese Kathryn Bigelow Roman Polanski Jane Campion George Lucas Agn\u00e9s Varda Brian De Palma Mira Nair Quentin Tarantino Examples of Films That Influenced Society Star Wars The Sound of Music To Kill a Mockingbird Schindler\u2019s List Star Trek Taxi Driver Close Encounters of the Third Kind Jaws Thelma and Louise Some Major Film Production Centers New York Indian Cinema: Bollywood Los Angeles: Hollywood United Kingdom: Pinewood FAQ Why have films become such an essential part of the arts? Films have become an essential part of the arts because films produce new thoughts and ideas, provoke new emotions, and stimulate our imagination. Does film influence society, or does society influence film? I would argue that art imitates life more than the other way around. Throughout the history of film, society has continually shaped film. When movies first emerged, they were mostly made for entertainment purposes. However, movies later became a way for filmmakers to promote certain values like social tolerance and equality. How did Hollywood influence American culture? Hollywood influenced American culture by reflecting the values and ideals of democracy and capitalism. For instance, Hollywood films promote the idea that people can do anything they set their mind to \u2013 the so-called \u2018American Dream.\u2019 How can films help us understand other cultures? Films can help us to understand other cultures by giving us an up-close and personal look at a foreign culture. Films are an excellent platform for connecting with other people\u2019s experiences that are very different from ours. Why is Hollywood so popular around the world? Great question! Hollywood became so popular worldwide because of several factors. These factors include:"

                "text": "Water is the most important and valuable natural resource on Earth. It sustains all life. There is no life without water. Water is not only important for human beings but for the entire ecosystem. Without enough water, the existence of humans, as well as animals, is next to impossible. After fresh air, water is the second most important natural resource for the survival of any living being. Water is necessary for the survival of each living creature on this planet, be it a small worm, plant, or full-grown tree. Animals and plants cannot survive without water. About 71% of Earth\u2019s surface is covered with water. Unfortunately, only 3% of the water available is freshwater. About two-thirds of the freshwater lies in the form of frozen glaciers and ice caps. The rest of the small portion is available in the form of groundwater and surface water. Depletion of fresh water has become a threat to our existence. According to some scientists, the quantity and the quality of water are degrading day by day. Although Earth is covered with almost 71% of water, the quality is that we cannot use it in day-to-day life for domestic purposes. Due to the increasing environmental pollution, the drops of water, which transmit life force to all the living beings, flora and fauna of the earth, is becoming contaminated. Therefore, the crisis of clean drinking water is the biggest crisis for the existence of human beings on this earth. The only solution to this problem is to bring awareness which requires immediate attention of individuals, institutions and government. Man may reach the heights of material progress and scientific achievements, but his life is incomplete without water. It is necessary for all of us to understand that it is only through water conservation and water management, we can overcome this crisis which is threatening our existence. It is being observed that size of rivers and traditional water sources are reducing day by day and this can lead to water scarcity in the near future times. Water is nectar For thousands of years, man searched for the nectar as described in mythological texts. But he didn\u2019t understand that water obtained from pure and natural sources is that nectar which provides him with life force and good health. Water is life and he is living in a world of modernity and materialism where he has forgotten the importance of water. He is thus, facing health related diseases and environmental disaster. Man is destroying the natural and traditional sources of water due to his greediness. Due to indiscriminate urbanization and industrialization, pollution of underground water and rivers is continuously increasing as all toxic chemical substances (industrial wastes) are secreted into the river. This is giving rise to shortage of clean drinking water. Drinking water obtained through scientific techniques and methods can never be a substitute for pure and naturally obtained drinking water. If there is water, there is future The golden future of man does not depend on the human settlements being built on the moon, but on pure natural drinking water. Pure drinking water is the golden future of humanity. Nature responds to our vibrations and natural resources were pure and pristine during the Golden Age. Satyuga (Golden age) is the world where clean and pure water is available through natural sources. It has been proved by the modern scientific researchers that the positive waves (vibes) generated by human thoughts makes water pure, satwic and energetic. Man can attain economic prosperity and attainment only by conserving water. So, water conservation is our primary and essential need. Clean air can be obtained only from clean water. Water is speaking to man in silent language, \u2018You conserve me, I will give you life.\u2019 Need for water conservation Water conservation is essential for making the earth green by reducing deserts, expanding the continuously shrinking water streams of rivers, raising the underground water level and for the well-being, progress and prosperity of human beings. In order to conserve rain water, motivate people to make \u2018Rain Water Harvesting System\u2019 in their house-courtyard, fields, open fields, etc. This step is the urgent need and call of the time. The underground water level can be raised by stopping the wasted water by making small dams. Ground water can be used as per minimum requirement. This is also a meaningful step towards water conservation. Creating awareness of water conservation Rajyoga and spirituality plays a vital role in creating special awareness among the people for water conservation. Creating awareness of pure and clean water among the people gives way for water conservation. People can be easily made aware of water conservation by instilling respect for elements of nature. Awareness of water conservation is very important for the existence of human life. Purification of Nature by Rajyoga Meditation Rajyoga meditation is a very effective technique for the development of inner consciousness and awareness towards human values and nature. The practice of Rajyoga develops satwic instincts and attitudes in man, due to which the ongoing struggle between man and nature ends. It also leads to overall harmony. In fact, there is a very deep connection between nature and spirituality. It has been proved through scientific research that the Powerful and positive thought waves that are generated by the practice of Rajyoga have a deep impact in the environment and nature. This also increases the productivity of plants and crops. It completely ends the dependence on toxic chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Due to this, both water and land are directly conserved and promoted. Contribution of Brahma Kumaris organization in water conservation Eco-friendly systems have been built for water conservation in international headquarters of Brahma Kumaris including Gyan Sarovar, Shantivan and other areas. In order to maintain the underground water level in the Shantivan campus, arrangements have been made to store 32 lakh litres of water and 8 lakh litres of water is purified by chain filter method and the used water is made clean again by recycling method and this water is used for watering plants. The campus is made green by irrigation. The Brahma Kumaris Organization regularly participates in UN conferences, seminars and campaigns on conservation of water and nature around the world. Here the youths are taught about conservation of water and nature. They are given various online training too. The Rural Development Wing of Rajyoga Education & Research Foundation, sister concern of Brahma Kumaris is playing an active role in this direction. Jal Jan Abhiyan Jal Jan Abhiyan is being implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti and the Brahma Kumaris organization. It is a positive initiative taken in the direction of water conservation to save human beings and humanity. The goal of water conservation can be achieved only by creating collective consciousness among the people by conserving water and nature. This campaign has been planned keeping in mind its objectives. Objectives of Jal -Jan Abhiyan: 1) Creating awareness among the people about water conservation through water management. 2) Motivating people to conserve water by \u2018Rain Water Harvesting System\u2019, in the land available with them. 3) Encouraging traditional sources of water conservation such as digging ponds and drains or building small water storages on sloping land. 4) Motivating people to plant trees on vacant lands and fields. 5) Motivating farmers to save water by irrigating with sprinkler method. 6) To generate positive consciousness among people towards water conservation through Rajyoga Meditation. 7) Seminars can be conducted to create awareness about water conservation. 8) Organizing Essay & debate competition for school or college students so that awareness can be created for water conservation. 9) Various fairs and exhibitions can be organized for farmers and villagers to create awareness for water conservation. 10) Religious and social organizations can play an important role in creating awareness among youth and women about water conservation. 11) To make people aware about water conservation through printing press, electronic and social media. 12) To bring awareness in every house towards water conservation."

                "text": "Pollutant control is crucial in the modern world as human activities result in worldwide air, water, and soil pollution. You can help with the world's pollution problem by recycling waste instead of putting it in the rubbish bin. This may seem insignificant, but the combined effects of regional recycling initiatives help limit environmental pollution. Today we shall briefly cover the principles of pollution control and then cover some of the methods used to control the release of a variety of dangerous pollutants. The meaning of pollution control Pollution control is the limitation or eradication of the release of harmful substances into the environment. The removal of dangerous substances can be considered pollutant control as well. Pollutant control only tackles waste and emissions released by human activity rather than emissions from natural sources. Harmful substances include greenhouse gases, metal particulates, smoke, carbon monoxide (CO), and oil. Volcanic activity is a natural method whereby dangerous chemicals are released into the environment; volcanic eruptions can release vast amounts of sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and soot. Effects of pollutants Polluting substances can damage the environment, ecosystems, and human health. Here are some key examples of how pollution affects our planet: Greenhouse gases [such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O)] released from fossil fuel combustion, industrial activity, and agriculture will contribute to the greenhouse effect and cause global warming. Climatic changes from warming, such as melting ice sheets, rising sea levels, droughts, and increased extreme weather, threaten ecosystems and pressurise low-income countries. Releasing toxic chemicals like metal compounds, hydrocarbons, and pesticides into watercourses puts aquatic ecosystems at risk. These poisonous substances will bioaccumulate (persist) in ecosystems and eventually undergo biomagnification which involves them becoming present in larger quantities at higher trophic levels. Carbon monoxide is released as a by-product of the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels in car engines. CO is an extremely dangerous molecule as it binds to haemoglobin (the blood-carrying molecule) and restricts the transportation of blood around the body, which can lead to seizures and heart attacks. Principles of pollution control These are the three principles of pollutant control that are used to varying degrees around the world: Accountability: This principle stresses that whichever individual or company is responsible for releasing pollutants into the environment should be accountable for these. Therefore, they should be the ones to implement removal methods and mitigate any further release of pollutants. Prevention: This principle suggests that any potential pollution released from an operation or activity should be stringently considered before commencing. This means considering any pollutant removal, storage, or neutralising methods and having them ready. Individual responsibility: This principle is more of a widespread plea as it is more challenging to implement strictly. It argues that the Earth is our home and we are lucky enough to have a habitable planet, so we should try our best to protect it. This means recycling, reducing vehicle use, and reducing mass consumption. The importance of pollutant control Let's take a look at some of the reasons pollutant control is important: Sustainable future: controlling emissions and waste is essential for reducing the degradation of the biologically productive land we depend on. This includes forests, agroecosystems, and oceans. Climate change : greenhouse gases (GHG) contribute to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere and warm the planet's system. Limiting GHG emissions is pivotal in preventing global warming. Human health: many pollutants, such as smoke, carbon monoxide, and metal particulates, threaten human health. Air and water pollution cause more death cases worldwide than any other factor. Economic pressure: post-pollution control methods are often expensive and complicated to carry out, so preventing pollution from the source is important in relieving the financial stress of countries. Methods of pollution control So now we know what pollution control is and the principles behind it, let's have a look at the methods individuals and companies use to control specific pollutants: Smoke (PM10) Often shrouded in black smog, smoke can contain carbon (C), tar, and ash and causes respiratory problems and even cancer in animals and humans. Smoke refers to the particulate matter released from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels from vehicle exhaust pipes, industrial factories, and power plants. Here are some of the methods used to reduce smoke pollution:"

                "text": "Post by on Sunday, January 2, 2022 Man is known as social animal since human existence and Neurobiology claims that humans are inherently social and hence like to be socially connected. Being connected with friends, relatives, neighbors and colleagues has played a significant role in bonding and hence relieves stress, anxiety, and sadness. There is a lot of scientific data which reveals that people with good social contacts and networking are less vulnerable to psychological issues and development of mental illnesses as compared to those people who are not socially connected. Humans communicate in different ways such as interpersonal communication, group communication etc. Earlier people communicated via letters, visiting each other and in time through telephone. With the advances in technology development in modes of communication with time, the access to internet and social media, world has become global village. Now it has become easier to reach out to anyone in any part of the world in no time. These days\u2019 people spend most of their time on social media platforms. After the emergence of COVID-19 infection people were advised to stay at home by their respective governments to curb the spread of the said infection which resulted in a boom of use of social media. According to recent data, as many as 90% of young adults currently spend time on social media sites and majority of them using WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, at least once per day. These figures are increasing day by day as social media has now become quite important in everyone\u2019s life. Social media has many positive and enjoyable benefits, but it can also have negative effects on us. Positive effects of social media \u00d8 By staying connected on social media we can find new friends and build relationships with like-minded people. \u00d8 We can nurture already existing relationships. \u00d8 Social media can be a great source for faster communication. \u00d8 We can stay in touch with our friends and family who are far away from us. \u00d8 Social media can raise a powerful voice for the underprivileged citizens of the society. \u00d8 It is easier to reach out to more people and put forward one\u2019s point of view. \u00d8 By sharing one\u2019s personal experiences on social media, we learn to empathize and relate with each other. \u00d8 Social media is capable of escaping boredom and refreshing one\u2019s mind so that one can have a fresh start and improve one\u2019s performance. \u00d8 On social media platforms we can raise awareness about any social cause and health issues. \u00d8 We can discuss new topics relevant to our society. \u00d8 Social media can be a great source of income for many. \u00d8 News from just about any part of the world can spread like never before on social media. \u00d8 It can be very helpful for expanding business. \u00d8 Social media is a great place for students to find mentors and training programs to learn new skills and gain knowledge. \u00d8 It has given new lease of life to learners and mentors by connecting during classes, conferences etc. through zoom meetings, Google Classrooms, WebEx etc. \u00d8 Many influencers will openly share their knowledge to help others grow. \u00d8 It enables such people to talk to others, discuss their mental health issues. \u00d8 Social media makes it infinitely easy for you to find content that serves your interests. Negative or toxic effects of social media \u00b7 Social media is highly addictive. It is a proven fact that people develop screen dependency and get addicted to social media sites. \u00b7 Social media can damage self-image. Social media sites provide tools that allow people to earn other\u2019s approval for their appearance and the possibility to compare themselves to others. \u00b7 False belief of control. Social media can make you believe that you can control the way you want to etc. \u00b7 Social media can actually make you lonely. Spending time in your room alone can make you lonely. It actually separates us from others. So, this is no replacement for real social networking, neighbours and friends. \u00b7 It brings sadness many a times Social media brings less moment-to-moment happiness. \u00b7 Infodemics: Pandemic and other catastrophes are complicated by false and baseless news which actually horrifies the society and spreads a lot of misinformation and hence contributes negatively. \u00b7 Danger of cyber bullying on social media. Cyber bullying is a growing concern, due to the horrific effects it had on teens over recent years. \u00b7 Students and teenagers waste a lot of time on social networking sites, which leads them to focus less on their academics. Playing online and offline games, watching pornography, fantasy / magical networks etc. distracts children from their real goals like academics, family, friends and so on. \u00b7 Social media can be the root cause of depression and anxiety How to handle the negative impact of social media? \u00b7 By keeping a smaller number of social media apps on your gadgets. \u00b7 By setting limits on the amount of time you spend on social media. \u00b7 By using social media to connect with people who inspire you, share similar interests, and provide a sense of belonging. \u00b7 By contributing to the social cause and helping in awareness. \u00b7 By spending more time with your family and friends outdoors. \u00b7 By keeping your cell phone on silent when not needed. \u00b7 By keeping away your phone before you go to sleep. \u00b7 By sharing positive thoughts on social media. \u00b7 By creating meaningful connections that may help you overcome the difficulties, when needed. \u00b7 By exercising daily. \u00b7 Practice religious activities/ mediation/ mindfulness. \u00b7 By keeping your personal information private. \u00b7 By managing your friend list and not allowing random people in your group. \u00b7 Be aware of privacy and security settings. \u00b7 By supervising your children\u2019s online time and sites visited. \u00b7 By educating your children about cyber bullying. \u00b7 By being careful regarding pop-ups and unfamiliar links. Social media affects our sleep pattern and has associations with depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. Overuse of social media can have greater impact on our concentration, attention and memory. Despite its drawbacks, social media remains an efficient means of connecting communities and individuals across the world. As with everything else, there is a positive and negative aspect to social media. When used wisely and in moderation, we can benefit from its constructive effects, and certainly deliver a positive impact on the society in ways mentioned above. It\u2019s not hard to break a habit that has a negative influence on one\u2019s wellbeing. It depends on our strong will and determination on how to control our social media addiction for good. In the present-day materialist world, there is too much negativity and we need to make sure that we use social media to reform by innovation, improvisation and introspection rather than complicating the problem further by negative contributions.",

                "text": "Without the greenhouse effect we would be living in a very chilly place\u2014the world's average temperature would be minus 18\u00b0C, instead of the 15\u00b0C we are used to. So what is the greenhouse effect, and how does it make Earth around 33\u00b0C warmer? The natural greenhouse effect The natural greenhouse effect is a phenomenon caused by gases naturally present in the atmosphere that affect the behaviour of the heat energy radiated by the sun. In simple terms, sunlight (shortwave radiation) passes through the atmosphere, and is absorbed by Earth\u2019s surface. This warms Earth\u2019s surface, and then Earth radiates some of this energy (as infrared, or longwave radiation) back towards space. As it passes through the atmosphere, gases such as (water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide absorb most of the energy. The energy is then re-emitted in all directions, so some energy escapes into space, but less than would have escaped if the atmosphere and its greenhouse gases weren\u2019t there. The result is that some of the sun's energy becomes \u2018trapped\u2019\u2014making the lower part of the atmosphere, and Earth, warmer than it would be otherwise. This process is known as the greenhouse effect because it is similar to how a greenhouse works the sun\u2019s energy passes through the glass (or similar) panes of the greenhouse, but not all of it is allowed to escape again, making the inside of the greenhouse a warmer and more hospitable environment for the plants inside. Earth\u2019s energy balance The rate at which energy is absorbed by Earth is approximately balanced by the rate at which it is emitted back into space, keeping the Earth in what\u2019s known as a state of equilibrium, and at a stable temperature. As long as the amount of greenhouse gases in the air stays the same, and the rate of energy arriving from the sun is constant, this equilibrium is maintained. In the state of equilibrium that existed during the centuries up until Industrial Revolution, which started in the late 1700s, the natural greenhouse effect maintained the average temperature of Earth\u2019s surface at around 15\u00b0C. Advances in human technology have also accellerated pollution levels, disrupting the atmosphere's ability to keep a stable temperature. Image source: Billy Wilson / Flickr. Greenhouse gases Scientists have been regularly measuring the atmosphere\u2019s carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) content since around 1960. Several stations around the world, including a number of Australian stations jointly operated by the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, monitor CO 2 and other greenhouse gases and contribute data to the Global Atmosphere Watch. But how can we find out the CO 2 concentrations that existed before this regular monitoring started? Evidence comes from a variety of sources, but one of the most straightforward involves taking ice samples from the polar ice caps. Ice sheets build up from the compression of each year's snowfalls. By drilling down into the ice (which is up to 4 kilometres thick), scientists can collect core samples of the annual snowfall going back over thousands of years. The deeper you go, the older the ice. This ice contains air bubbles, captured when the snow fell and sealed in ice since that time. Scientists can take a slice of a core and analyse the air trapped within the bubbles. This ice record can give us information about the air from as far back as 800,000 years ago. The ice record shows that for many thousands of years the CO 2 concentration slowly fluctuated. It remained steady during the past few thousand years, but began to increase about the year 1800\u2014as did methane and nitrous oxide. Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are now higher than they were at any time over the past 800,000 years. Carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) The increase in CO 2 is partly caused by fossil-fuel burning, cement manufacture, land clearing, forest harvesting and changes in agricultural practice. According to the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory of 2011, CO 2 accounts for 74 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. Methane Emissions from landfill, biomass burning, increased agricultural production in rice paddy fields, digestive fermentation (burps and farts) from cattle and other livestock, and leaks from natural gas pipelines and coal mines have led to a steady increase in methane emissions. Methane production accounts for 20 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, and emissions of this gas have increased at a faster rate than CO 2 . Scientists are concerned that global warming will result in the release of even more methane if permafrost melts. Nitrous oxide There are many small sources of this gas, both natural and manufactured, that are difficult to quantify. The main sources created by human activity are agriculture (especially the development of pastures in tropical regions), biomass burning and a number of industrial processes. Nitrous oxide production accounts for 4 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. Halocarbons Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are halocarbons which were widely used for propellants, refrigerants, and foaming agents. Their use rapidly increased after their invention in the 1930s. The realisation that they were responsible for ozone depletion in the stratosphere has led to their phasing out under the 1987 Montreal Protocol. Perfluorocarbons, another type of halocarbon, are produced during aluminium production. Halocarbon production accounts for 1.1 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. The composition of the atmosphere is changing Earth's atmosphere is made up of 78 per cent nitrogen and 21 per cent oxygen. Only about 1 per cent is made up of natural greenhouse gases, but this comparatively small amount of gas makes a big difference. The Industrial Revolution brought new industrial processes, an increase in the burning of fossil fuels, more extensive agriculture, and a rapid increase in the world's population. This rapid increase in human activity led to the (still ongoing) emission of significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. We know this because of measurements made over the past 50 years and the analysis of air bubbles trapped in ancient ice, which show that levels of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and halocarbons are increasing. Although Earth\u2019s atmosphere has changed significantly over geological time, and high concentrations of greenhouse gases have been present in Earth\u2019s atmosphere in the past, never before has Earth been subjected to such a large increase in the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over such a short time. Although over a geological timeframe (thousands to millions of years), life on Earth would be able to gradually adapt to the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, the comparative equilibrium that has existed for the past 10,000 years or so is being disturbed at such a rapid rate that adaptation might not be possible."

The site\u2019s high montane forest ecosystems influence the Indian monsoon weather pattern. Moderating the tropical climate of the region, the site presents one of the best examples of the monsoon system on the planet. It also has an exceptionally high level of biological diversity and endemism and is recognized as one of the world\u2019s eight \u2018hottest hotspots\u2019 of biological diversity. The forests of the site include some of the best representatives of non-equatorial tropical evergreen forests anywhere and are home to at least 325 globally threatened flora, fauna, bird, amphibian, reptile and fish species. Outstanding Universal Value Brief synthesis The Western Ghats are internationally recognized as a region of immense global importance for the conservation of biological diversity, besides containing areas of high geological, cultural and aesthetic values. A chain of mountains running parallel to India\u2019s western coast, approximately 30-50 km inland, the Ghats traverse the States of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat. These mountains cover an area of around 140,000 km\u00b2 in a 1,600 km long stretch that is interrupted only by the 30 km Palghat Gap at around 11\u00b0N. Older than the great Himalayan mountain chain, the Western Ghats of India are a geomorphic feature of immense global importance. The Outstanding Universal Value of the Western Ghats is manifested in the region\u2019s unique and fascinating influence on large-scale biophysical and ecological processes over the entire Indian peninsula. The mountains of the Western Ghats and their characteristic montane forest ecosystems influence the Indian monsoon weather patterns that mediate the warm tropical climate of the region, presenting one of the best examples of the tropical monsoon system on the planet. The Ghats act as a key barrier, intercepting the rain-laden monsoon winds that sweep in from the south-west during late summer. A significant characteristic of the Western Ghats is the exceptionally high level of biological diversity and endemism. This mountain chain is recognized as one of the world\u2019s eight \u2018hottest hotspots\u2019 of biological diversity along with Sri Lanka. The forests of the Western Ghats include some of the best representatives of non equatorial tropical evergreen forests in the world. At least 325 globally threatened (IUCN Red Data List) species occur in the Western Ghats. The globally threatened flora and fauna in the Western Ghats are represented by 229 plant species, 31 mammal species, 15 bird species, 43 amphibian species, 5 reptile species and 1 fish species. Of the total 325 globally threatened species in the Western Ghats, 129 are classified as Vulnerable, 145 as Endangered and 51 as Critically Endangered. Criterion (ix): The Western Ghats region demonstrates speciation related to the breakup of the ancient landmass of Gondwanaland in the early Jurassic period; secondly to the formation of India into an isolated landmass and the thirdly to the Indian landmass being pushed together with Eurasia. Together with favourable weather patterns and a high gradient being present in the Ghats, high speciation has resulted. The Western Ghats is an \u201cEvolutionary Ecotone\u201d illustrating \u201cOut of Africa\u201d and \u201cOut of Asia\u201d hypotheses on species dispersal and vicariance.[tb1] Criterion (x): The Western Ghats contain exceptional levels of plant and animal diversity and endemicity for a continental area. In particular, the level of endemicity for some of the 4-5,000 plant species recorded in the Ghats is very high: of the nearly 650 tree species found in the Western Ghats, 352 (54%) are endemic. Animal diversity is also exceptional, with amphibians (up to 179 species, 65% endemic), reptiles (157 species, 62% endemic), and fishes (219 species, 53% endemic). Invertebrate biodiversity, once better known, is likely also to be very high (with some 80% of tiger beetles endemic). A number of flagship mammals occur in the property, including parts of the single largest population of globally threatened \u2018landscape\u2019 species such as the Asian Elephant, Gaur and Tiger. Endangered species such as the lion-tailed Macaque, Nilgiri Tahr and Nilgiri Langur are unique to the area. The property is also key to the conservation of a number of threatened habitats, such as unique seasonally mass-flowering wildflower meadows, Shola forests and Myristica swamps. Integrity The property is made up of 39 component parts grouped into 7 sub-clusters. The serial approach is justified in principle from a biodiversity perspective because all 39 components belong to the same biogeographic province, and remain as isolated remnants of previous contiguous forest. The justification for developing a serial approach rather than just identifying one large protected area to represent the biodiversity of the Western Ghats is due to the high degree of endemism, meaning that species composition from the very north of the mountains to 1,600km south varies greatly, and no one site could tell the story of the richness of these mountains. The formulation of this complex serial nomination has evolved through a consultative process drawing on scientific analysis from various sources. [tb5] The 39 component parts grouped into 7 sub-clusters together reflect the Outstanding Universal Value of the property and capture the range of biological diversity and species endemism in this vast landscape. Protection and management requirements The 39 component parts of this serial property fall under a number of protection regimes, ranging from Tiger Reserves, National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, and Reserved Forests. All components are owned by the State and are subject to stringent protection under laws including the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972, the Indian Forest Act of 1927, and the Forest Conservation Act (1980). Through these laws the components are under the control of the Forestry Department and the Chief Wildlife Warden, providing legal protection. 40% of the property lies outside of the formal protected area system, mostly in Reserved Forests, which are legally protected and effectively managed. The Forest Conservation Act (1980) provides the regulatory framework to protect them from infrastructure development. Integrating the management of 39 components across 4 States is a challenge, for which a 3-tier governance mechanism is required that will operate at the Central, State and Site levels to provide effective coordination and oversight to the 39 components. A Western Ghats Natural Heritage Management Committee (WGNHMC) under the auspices of the Ministry of Environment of Forests (MoEF), Government of India to deal with coordination and integration issues is already functional. All 39 components in the 7 sub-clusters are managed under specific management / working plans duly approved by the State/Central governments. The livelihood concerns of the local communities are regulated by the Forest Rights Acts, 2006 and their participation in governance is ensured through Village Ecodevelopment Committees (VECs).",

The physical and human geography of Southeast Asia allowed these attributes to develop in the Khmer civilization. In addition to material goods, the Khmer civilization facilitated a powerful trade in ideas. ConflictThe primary conflicts of the Khmer civilization were waged with neighboring communities\u2014the Cham, the Vietnamese, and the Thai. Angkor, the capital of the ancient Khmer civilization, is home to one of the largest most distinctive religious monuments in the world, Angkor Wat.",

                "heading": "Key Components of Civilization",
                "text": "Civilization describes a complex way of life that came about as people began to develop networks of urban settlements. The earliest civilizations developed between 4000 and 3000 B.C.E., when the rise of agriculture and trade allowed people to have surplus food and economic stability. Many people no longer had to practice farming, allowing a diverse array of professions and interests to flourish in a relatively confined area. Civilizations first appeared in Mesopotamia (what is now Iraq) and later in Egypt. Civilizations thrived in the Indus Valley by about 2500 B.C.E., in China by about 1500 B.C.E. and in Central America (what is now Mexico) by about 1200 B.C.E. Civilizations ultimately developed on every continent except Antarctica. Characteristics of Civilization All civilizations have certain characteristics. These include: large population centers; monumental architecture and unique art styles; shared communication strategies; systems for administering territories; a complex division of labor; and the division of people into social and economic classes. Urban Areas Large population centers, or urban areas, allow civilizations to develop, although people who live outside these urban centers are still part of that region\u2019s civilization. Rural residents of civilizations may include farmers, fishers, and traders, who regularly sell their goods and services to urban residents. The huge urban center of Teotihuacan, in modern-day Mexico, for example, had as many as 200,000 residents between 300 and 600 C.E. The development of the Teotihuacano civilization was made possible in part by the rich agricultural land surrounding the city. As land was cultivated, fewer farmers could supply more food staples, such as corn and beans, to more people. Trade also played a part in Teotihuacan\u2019s urban development. Much of the wealth and power of Teotihuacan was due to excavating and trading the rich deposits of obsidian around the city. Obsidian is a hard volcanic rock that was highly valued as a cutting tool. Teotihuacano merchants traded (exported) obsidian to surrounding cultures in exchange for goods and services imported to Teotihuacano settlements. Monuments All civilizations work to preserve their legacy by building large monuments and structures. This is as true today as it was thousands of years ago. For example, the ancient monuments at Great Zimbabwe are still consistently used as a symbol of political power in the modern nation of Zimbabwe. Great Zimbabwe, constructed between 1100 and 1450, describes the ruins of the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe. At its peak, Great Zimbabwe was inhabited by more than 10,000 people and was part of a trading network that extended from the Maghreb, through the eastern coast of Africa, and as far east as India and China. Great Zimbabwe is a testament to the sophistication and ingenuity of ancestors of the local Shona people. Politicians like Robert Mugabe, the president who led Zimbabwe for nearly 40 years in the 20th and 21st centuries, built their entire political identities by associating themselves with the ancient civilization\u2019s monumental architecture. Buildings are not the only monuments that define civilizations. The distinct artistic style of Great Zimbabwe included representations of native animals carved in soapstone. The stylized stone sculptures known as \u201cZimbabwe Birds\u201d, for example, remain an emblem of Zimbabwe, appearing on the nation\u2019s flag, currency, and coats of arms. Shared Communication Shared communication is another element that all civilizations share. Shared communication may include spoken language; alphabets; numeric systems; signs, ideas, and symbols; and illustration and representation. Shared communication allows the infrastructure necessary for technology, trade, cultural exchange, and government to be developed and shared throughout the civilization. The Inca civilization, for example, had no written script that we know of, but its complex khipu system of accounting allowed the government to conduct censuses of its population and production across the vast stretch of the Andes. A khipu is a recording device made of a series of strings knotted in particular patterns and colors. Written language in particular allows civilizations to record their own history and everyday events\u2014crucial for understanding ancient cultures. The world's oldest known written language is Sumerian, which developed in Mesopotamia around 3100 B.C.E. The most familiar form of early Sumerian writing was called cuneiform, and was made up of different collections of wedge (triangle) shapes. The earliest Sumerian writing was record-keeping. Just like written records of modern civilizations, Sumerian cuneiform kept track of taxes, grocery bills, and laws for things like theft. Written language was a key part of shared communication during the Islamic Golden Age, which flourished in southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia from the seventh to the 13th centuries. So-called \u201cArabic numerals\u201d and the Arabic language were shared communications that allowed diverse cultures across the Arabic world to contribute the dazzling advances in mathematics, science, technology, and the arts. Infrastructure and Administration All civilizations rely on government administration\u2014bureaucracy. Perhaps no civilization better exemplifies this than ancient Rome. The word \u201ccivilization\u201d itself comes from the Latin word civis\ufeff, meaning \"citizen.\" Latin was the language of ancient Rome, whose territory stretched from the Mediterranean basin all the way to parts of Great Britain in the north and the Black Sea to the east. To rule an area that large, the Romans, based in what is now central Italy, needed an effective system of government administration and infrastructure. Romans used a variety of methods to administer their republic and, later, empire. Engineering, for instance, was a key part of Roman administration. Romans built a network of roads so that communication between far-away territories was as efficient as possible. Roads also made travel by the Roman military much easier. Romans built structures of their civilization everywhere they went: aqueducts supplied freshwater to towns for improved sanitation and hygiene, for example. Language also played a part in Roman infrastructure. Romans spread the Latin language throughout southern Europe. The so-called \"Romance languages\" (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Romanian, Catalan, and Italian) are called that because they all developed from the Roman language: Latin. Having a similar language made communication and leadership easier for Rome in its far-flung territories. Roman leaders relied on a series of legal codes for administration. These codes helped structure laws between different parts of Roman territory, as well as between rich and poor, men and women, slave and free. Roman laws included restrictions on marriage, ownership of land, and access to professions such as priesthoods. One of Rome\u2019s most lasting contributions to Western Civilization was the establishment of legal culture itself. Roman law was largely public, and jurists created such formalities as legal language and procedure that would define European law for centuries. In fact, \u201cRoman law\u201d describes the legal system used throughout Western Europe through the 18th century. Finally, Romans used local leaders, as well as Romans, to administer the law in their territories. Residents were more familiar with their own leaders, and more likely to follow their announcements. Israeli leaders worked with Roman authorities in the Roman territory of Palestine, for example, while British leaders often worked with Romans on the island of Great Britain. Some people born in Roman territories eventually became Roman emperors: The emperor Constantine, for instance, was born in what is now Serbia; the emperor Hadrian may have been born in what is now Spain. This interaction reduced conflict between Rome and its territories. Division of Labor Civilizations are marked by complex divisions of labor. This means that different people perform specialized tasks. In a purely agricultural society, members of the community are largely self-sufficient, and can provide food, shelter, and clothing for themselves. In a complex civilization, farmers may cultivate one type of crop and depend on other people for other foods, clothing, shelter, and information. Civilizations that depend on trade are specially marked by divisions of labor. The city of Timbuktu, in what is now Mali, was an important trading center for several African civilizations. Residents of Timbuktu specialized in trading such goods as gold, ivory, or enslaved people. Other residents provided food or shelter for trade caravans traveling on camels from the Sahara. The urban center of Timbuktu was also a center of learning. Its division of labor included not only merchants, but doctors, religious leaders, and artists. Class Structure The last element that is key to the development of civilizations is the division of people into classes. This is a complex idea that can be broken down into two parts: income and type of work performed. Changing classes has traditionally been difficult and happens over generations. Classes can mean groups of people divided by their income. This division is sometimes characterized as \u201ceconomic class.\u201d Modern Western Civilization often divides economic classes into wealthy, middle-class, and poor. In medieval civilizations of Europe, there were fewer economic classes. Kings and queens had enormous amounts of money and land. Serfs, or people who worked the land, had almost nothing. Eventually, a merchant economic class developed. Class can also refer to the type of work people perform. There are many divisions of social class. Social class is often associated with economic class, but not strictly defined by it. In the ancient civilization of China, there were four major types of social classes. Scholars and political leaders (known as shi) were the most powerful social class. Farmers and agricultural workers (nong) were the next most-powerful group. Artists (gong), who made everything from horseshoes to silk robes, were the next order of social class. At the bottom of the social classes were the merchants and traders, who bought and sold goods and services. Known as shang\ufeff, these merchants were often much wealthier than the other classes but had a lower social status. Development of Civilization Civilizations expand through trade, conflict, and exploration. Usually, all three elements must be present for a civilization to grow and remain stable for a long period of time. The physical and human geography of Southeast Asia allowed these attributes to develop in the Khmer civilization. The Khmer flourished in parts of what are now Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar between 800 and 1400. Trade The Khmer maintained vibrant trading relationships throughout East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and even Europe and Africa through the Silk Road, a collection of both overland and maritime trade routes. The Silk Road linked the spice and silk markets of Asia with the merchants of Europe. Southeast Asia\u2019s extensive network of waterways facilitated trade, with the Khmer capital of Angkor being built on the shores of Southeast Asia\u2019s largest freshwater lake, Tonle Sap. The outflowing Tonle Sap River is a tributary of the mighty Mekong River, which connects Southeast Asia with the Tibetan Plateau in the north and the South China Sea in the south. In addition to material goods, the Khmer civilization facilitated a powerful trade in ideas. In particular, the Khmer were instrumental in spreading the influence of Buddhist and Hindu cultures from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. Conflict The primary conflicts of the Khmer civilization were waged with neighboring communities\u2014the Cham, the Vietnamese, and the Thai. The Cham were a collection of kingdoms in what is today central and southern Vietnam, while the ancient Vietnamese influence extended through what is today northern Vietnam. Thai kingdoms such as Sukothai and Ayutthaya flourished in what are now Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia. The Khmer civilization was founded on the consistent resistance of political pressure from the Cham and Vietnamese, but it ultimately could not withstand pressure from Thai civilizations. Thousands of Thai peoples migrated from the north (what is now the Yunnan region of China), establishing small kingdoms in the southwest of the Khmer Empire. Eventually, these kingdoms became strong enough to annex Khmer territory, leading to Ayutthaya\u2019s conquest of the Khmer capital of Angkor in 1431. Exploration and Innovation The Khmer civilization relied heavily on rice farming, and developed a complex irrigation system to take advantage of the rivers and wetlands that dotted their territory. An efficient series of irrigation canals and reservoirs, called barays, allowed fewer farmers to produce more rice. This, in turn, allowed more people to pursue nonagricultural lifestyles and migrate to great urban areas, such as Angkor. Angkor, the capital of the ancient Khmer civilization, is home to one of the largest most distinctive religious monuments in the world, Angkor Wat. Angkor Wat was originally constructed as a series of shrines to the Hindu god Vishnu in the early 12th century, although it became a Buddhist temple complex less than a hundred years later. Angkor Wat and its sister complex, Angkor Thom, are beautiful examples of classic Khmer architecture. The towering, stepped pyramid towers of Angkor Wat are called \u201ctemple mountains.\u201d The towers are surrounded by open gallery walkways, and the entire structure is enclosed by a wall and square moat. The thousands of square meters of wall space at Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom are decorated by thousands of bas-reliefs and sculptures depicting Hindu stories and characters. The Khmer monument at Angkor Wat helps define the modern nation of Cambodia today. It is the nation\u2019s primary tourist attraction, a World Heritage Site, and even appears on the Cambodian flag. Fall of Civilizations Many civilizations have flourished and then failed or fell apart. There are many reasons for this, but many historians point to three patterns in the fall of civilizations: internal change, external pressure, and environmental collapse. The fall of civilizations is never the result of a single event or pattern. Sometimes, civilizations seem to \u201cdisappear\u201d entirely. Internal Change Population dynamics are the most pervasive forces of internal change to a civilization. A sudden population shift or a shift in demographics may force a civilization\u2019s infrastructure to break down. Populations may grow, due to migration or a period of unusual health. Populations may shrink, due to disease, extreme weather, or other environmental factors. Finally, populations may redefine themselves. As civilizations grow, cities may grow larger and become more culturally distinct from rural, agricultural areas. Large empires may extend across such large regions that languages, cultures, and customs may dilute the identity of the empire\u2019s residents. Internal changes contributed to the collapse of the Maya civilization, which had thrived in Mesoamerica for more than a thousand years. The \u201cClassic Maya\u201d collapse happened relatively quickly in the 800s. Diseases such as dysentery and lethal hemorrhagic fevers killed and disabled thousands of Mayans. Millions more were forced to relocate from cities to more rural areas. Such huge population shifts reduced the ability of the Maya to communicate, administrate, and unite against outside forces and natural disasters (such as drought). External Pressure The clearest example of external pressure on a civilization is foreign invasion or sustained warfare. Protecting a civilization\u2019s borders can be extremely expensive and demand a strong military at the expense of developing or maintaining other aspects of a civilization. External pressure can lead to the relatively abrupt end of a civilization (and, often, the adoption of another). The fall of the Aztec Empire with the arrival of European conquistadores is such an example. External pressures can also lead to the gradual diminishing of a civilization. The \u201cfall\u201d of what we often think of as Ancient Egypt is a good example of how external pressures can redefine a civilization over hundreds of years. Egypt had faced longstanding, intermittent conflict on its borders, with competing civilizations such as the Nubians (to the south), the Assyrians (in the Middle East), and the Libyans (to the west). Later, Egypt encountered the civilizations of Ancient Greece and Rome, and eventually became part of the Roman Empire. Ancient Egypt also faced external pressures not directly associated with armed conflict. The powerful forces of Christianity and Islam influenced the eradication of both hieroglyphics, the writing system of Ancient Egypt, and its polytheistic religion. Environmental Collapse Some anthropologists think that both natural disasters and misuse of the environment contributed to the decline of many civilizations. Natural hazards such as drought, floods, and tsunamis, become natural disasters as they impact civilizations. Drought contributed to the fall of civilizations such as the Maya and the Indus Valley or Harappan civilization. The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in what is now Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan. The Indus Valley Civilization depended on seasonal monsoon rains to supply water for drinking, hygiene, and irrigation. Climate change made monsoons much more unpredictable and seasonal flooding less reliable. Harappans suffered from water-borne diseases and were unable to effectively irrigate their crops. The collapse of Minoan civilization, a major influence on Ancient Greece, is often associated with a catastrophic eruption of the Thera volcano on the island of what is now Santorini. The eruption caused a massive tsunami that reduced the population, trading capabilities, and influence of the Minoans. Human activity can also strain the environment to the point of a civilization\u2019s collapse. One of several factors contributing to the collapse of the Viking outpost in Greenland, for instance, was the failure of European settlers to adapt to Greenland\u2019s climate and soil. Farming methods that were successful in the rich, loamy soils of Northern Europe were ill-suited to Greenland\u2019s colder, thinner soil and shorter growing seasons. The land could not support the crops necessary to sustain Viking livestock, including goats, cattle, and sheep. In addition, the land itself was harvested for peat, the outpost\u2019s primary construction material. The Vikings in Greenland also faced internal pressures, such as a weak trading system with Europe, and external pressures, such as a hostile relationship with their Inuit neighbors. \u2018Lost Civilizations\u2019 History and myth are rich with \u201clost civilizations,\u201d entire ways of life that seemed to flourish and then disappear from the historical record. The disappearance of the Ancestral Puebloan civilization is one such mystery. Ancestral Puebloan civilization thrived in what is now the Four Corners region of the United States: the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Ancestral Puebloan civilization developed around 1200 B.C.E. and thrived for more than a thousand years. Ancestral Puebloan civilization was marked by monumental architecture in the form of apartment-like cliff dwellings and large urban areas known as pueblos. Culturally diverse Ancestral Puebloans were connected by a complex road system, a standard style of religious worship, and a unique art style evidenced by pottery and petroglyphs. Ancestral Puebloans seem to have abandoned their urban areas around 1300 C.E. The disappearance of this civilization remains a mystery, although most scientists say Ancestral Puebloans engaged in warfare with their Navajo neighbors, internal groups competed for land and resources, and sustained droughts reduced Ancestral Puebloan ability to irrigate crops in the arid Southwest. The Pueblo people never disappeared, of course: Diverse groups developed their own, competing civilizations after the Ancestral Puebloans migrated or fell apart. These groups include the Zuni and Hopi civilizations."

                "text": "The Indus Valley Civilization was a cultural and political entity which flourished in the northern region of the Indian subcontinent between c. 7000 - c. 600 BCE. Its modern name derives from its location in the valley of the Indus River, but it is also commonly referred to as the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization and the Harrapan Civilization. These latter designations come from the Sarasvati River mentioned in Vedic sources, which flowed adjacent to the Indus River, and the ancient city of Harappa in the region, the first one found in the modern era. None of these names derive from any ancient texts because, although scholars generally believe the people of this civilization developed a writing system (known as Indus Script or Harappan Script) it has not yet been deciphered. Remove Ads Advertisement All three designations are modern constructs, and nothing is definitively known of the origin, development, decline, and fall of the civilization. Even so, modern archaeology has established a probable chronology and periodization: Pre-Harappan \u2013 c. 7000 - c. 5500 BCE Early Harappan \u2013 c. 5500 - 2800 BCE Mature Harappan \u2013 c. 2800 - c. 1900 BCE Late Harappan \u2013 c. 1900 - c. 1500 BCE Post Harappan \u2013 c. 1500 - c. 600 BCE The Indus Valley Civilization is now often compared with the far more famous cultures of Egypt and Mesopotamia, but this is a fairly recent development. The discovery of Harappa in 1829 CE was the first indication that any such civilization existed in India, and by that time, Egyptian hieroglyphics had been deciphered, Egyptian and Mesopotamian sites excavated, and cuneiform would soon be translated by the scholar George Smith (l. 1840-1876 CE). Archaeological excavations of the Indus Valley Civilization, therefore, had a significantly late start comparatively, and it is now thought that many of the accomplishments and \u201cfirsts\u201d attributed to Egypt and Mesopotamia may actually belong to the people of the Indus Valley Civilization. The total population of the civilization is thought to have been upward of 5 million, & its territory stretched over 900 miles (1,500 km) along the Indus River. The two best-known excavated cities of this culture are Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (located in modern-day Pakistan), both of which are thought to have once had populations of between 40,000-50,000 people, which is stunning when one realizes that most ancient cities had on average 10,000 people living in them. The total population of the civilization is thought to have been upward of 5 million, and its territory stretched over 900 miles (1,500 km) along the banks of the Indus River and then in all directions outward. Indus Valley Civilization sites have been found near the border of Nepal, in Afghanistan, on the coasts of India, and around Delhi, to name only a few locations. Remove Ads Advertisement Between c. 1900 - c. 1500 BCE, the civilization began to decline for unknown reasons. In the early 20th century CE, this was thought to have been caused by an invasion of light-skinned peoples from the north known as Aryans who conquered a dark-skinned people defined by Western scholars as Dravidians. This claim, known as the Aryan Invasion Theory, has been discredited. The Aryans \u2013 whose ethnicity is associated with the Iranian Persians \u2013 are now believed to have migrated to the region peacefully and blended their culture with that of the indigenous people while the term Dravidian is understood now to refer to anyone, of any ethnicity, who speaks one of the Dravidian languages. Why the Indus Valley Civilization declined and fell is unknown, but scholars believe it may have had to do with climate change, the drying up of the Sarasvati River, an alteration in the path of the monsoon which watered crops, overpopulation of the cities, a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia, or a combination of any of the above. In the present day, excavations continue at many of the sites found thus far and some future find may provide more information on the history and decline of the culture. Remove Ads Advertisement Discovery & Early Excavation The symbols and inscriptions on the artifacts of the people of the Indus Valley Civilization, which have been interpreted by some scholars as a writing system, remain undeciphered and so archaeologists generally avoid defining an origin for the culture as any attempt would be speculative. All that can be known of the civilization to date comes from the physical evidence excavated at various sites. The story of the Indus Valley Civilization, therefore, is best given with the discovery of its ruins in the 19th century CE. James Lewis (better known as Charles Masson, l. 1800-1853 CE) was a British soldier serving in the artillery of the East India Company Army when, in 1827 CE, he deserted with another soldier. In order to avoid detection by authorities, he changed his name to Charles Masson and embarked on a series of travels throughout India. Masson was an avid numismatist (coin collector) who was especially interested in old coins and, in following various leads, wound up excavating ancient sites on his own. One of these sites was Harappa, which he found in 1829 CE. He seems to have left the site fairly quickly, after making a record of it in his notes but, having no knowledge of who could have built the city, wrongly attributed it to Alexander the Great during his campaigns in India c. 326 BCE. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! Indus Valley Civilization - Mature Harappan Phase Avantiputra7 (CC BY-SA) When Masson returned to Britain after his adventures (and having been somehow forgiven his desertion), he published his book Narrative of Various Journeys in Balochistan, Afghanistan and the Punjab in 1842 CE which attracted the attention of the British authorities in India and, especially, Alexander Cunningham. Sir Alexander Cunningham (l. 1814-1893 CE), a British engineer in the country with a passion for ancient history, founded the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1861 CE, an organization dedicated to maintaining a professional standard of excavation and preservation of historic sites. Cunningham began excavations of the site and published his interpretation in 1875 CE (in which he identified and named the Indus Script) but this was incomplete and lacked definition because Harappa remained isolated with no connection to any known past civilization which could have built it. In 1904 CE, a new director of the ASI was appointed, John Marshall (l. 1876-1958 CE), who later visited Harappa and concluded the site represented an ancient civilization previously unknown. He ordered the site to be fully excavated and, at about the same time, heard of another site some miles away which the local people referred to as Mohenjo-daro (\u201cthe mound of the dead\u201d) because of bones, both animal and human, found there along with various artifacts. Excavations at Mohenjo-daro began in the 1924-1925 season and the similarities of the two sites were recognized; the Indus Valley Civilization had been discovered. Harappa & Mohenjo-daro The Hindu texts known as the Vedas, as well as other great works of Indian tradition such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana, were already well known to Western scholars but they did not know what culture had created them. Systemic racism of the time prevented them from attributing the works to the people of India, and the same, at first, led archaeologists to conclude that Harappa was a colony of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia or perhaps an Egyptian outpost. Remove Ads Advertisement Harappa Muhammad Bin Naveed (CC BY-SA) Harappa did not conform to either Egyptian or Mesopotamian architecture, however, as there was no evidence of temples, palaces, or monumental structures, no names of kings or queens or stelae or royal statuary. The city spread over 370 acres (150 hectares) of small, brick houses with flat roofs made of clay. There was a citadel, walls, the streets were laid out in a grid pattern clearly demonstrating a high degree of skill in urban planning and, in comparing the two sites, it was apparent to the excavators that they were dealing with a highly advanced culture. Houses in both cities had flush toilets, a sewer system, and fixtures on either side of the streets were part of an elaborate drainage system, which was more advanced even than that of the early Romans. Devices known from Persia as \u201cwind catchers\u201d were attached to the roofs of some buildings which provided air conditioning for the home or administrative office and, at Mohenjo-daro, there was a great public bath, surrounded by a courtyard, with steps leading down into it. As other sites were unearthed, the same degree of sophistication and skill came to light as well as the understanding that all of these cities had been pre-planned. Unlike those of other cultures which usually developed from smaller, rural communities, the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization had been thought out, a site chosen, and purposefully constructed prior to full habitation. Further, they all exhibited conformity to a single vision which further suggested a strong central government with an efficient bureaucracy that could plan, fund, and build such cities. Scholar John Keay comments: Remove Ads Advertisement What amazed all these pioneers, and what remains the distinctive characteristic of the several hundred Harappan sites now known, is their apparent similarity: \u201cOur overwhelming impression is of cultural uniformity, both throughout the several centuries during which the Harappan civilization flourished, and over the vast area it occupied.\u201d The ubiquitous bricks, for instance, are all of standardized dimensions, just as the stone cubes used by the Harappans to measure weights are also standard and based on the modular system. Road widths conform to a similar module; thus, streets are typically twice the width of side lanes, while the main arteries are twice or one and a half times the width of streets. Most of the streets so far excavated are straight and run either north-south or east-west. City plans therefore conform to a regular grid pattern and appear to have retained this layout through several phases of building. (9) Excavations at both sites continued between 1944-1948 CE under the direction of the British archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler (l. 1890-1976 CE) whose racialist ideology made it difficult for him to accept that dark-skinned people had built the cities. Even so, he managed to establish stratigraphy for Harappa and lay the foundation for the later periodization of the Indus Valley Civilization. Great Bath, Mohenjo-daro Benny Lin (CC BY-NC) Chronology Wheeler's work provided archaeologists with the means to recognize approximate dates from the civilization's foundations through its decline and fall. The chronology is primarily based, as noted, on physical evidence from Harappan sites but also from knowledge of their trade contacts with Egypt and Mesopotamia. Lapis lazuli, to name only one product, was immensely popular in both cultures and, although scholars knew it came from India, they did not know from precisely where until the Indus Valley Civilization was discovered. Even though this semi-precious stone would continue to be imported after the fall of the Indus Valley Civilization, it is clear that, initially, some of the export came from this region.

Harappan Civilization (Artist's Impression) Amplitude Studios (Copyright) Aspects of Culture The people seem to have been primarily artisans, farmers, and merchants. There is no evidence of a standing army, no palaces, and no temples. The Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro is believed to have been used for ritual purification rites related to religious belief but this is conjecture; it could as easily have been a public pool for recreation. Each city seems to have had its own governor but, it is speculated, there must have been some form of centralized government in order to achieve the uniformity of the cities. John Keay comments: Harappan tools, utensils, and materials confirm this impression of uniformity. Unfamiliar with iron \u2013 which was nowhere known in the third millennium BC \u2013 the Harappans sliced, scraped, beveled, and bored with 'effortless competence' using a standardized kit of tools made from chert, a kind of quartz, or from copper and bronze. These last, along with gold and silver, were the only metals available. They were also used for casting vessels and statuettes and for fashioning a variety of knives, fishhooks, arrowheads, saws, chisels, sickles, pins, and bangles. (10) Among the thousands of artifacts discovered at the various sites are small, soapstone seals a little over an inch (3 cm) in diameter which archaeologists interpret to have been used for personal identification in trade. Like the cylinder seals of Mesopotamia, these seals are thought to have been used to sign contracts, authorize land sales, and authenticate point-of-origin, shipment, and receipt of goods in trade long distance. Unicorn Seal - Indus Script Mukul Banerjee (Copyright) The people had developed the wheel, carts drawn by cattle, flat-bottomed boats wide enough to transport trade goods, and may have also developed the sail. In agriculture, they understood and made use of irrigation techniques and canals, various farming implements, and established different areas for cattle grazing and crops. Fertility rituals may have been observed for a full harvest as well as pregnancies of women as evidenced by a number of figurines, amulets, and statuettes in female form. It is thought that the people may have worshipped a Mother Goddess deity and, possibly, a male consort depicted as a horned figure in the company of wild animals. The religious beliefs of the culture, however, are unknown and any suggestions must be speculative. Their level of artistic skill is evident through numerous finds of statuary, soapstone seals, ceramics, and jewelry. The most famous artwork is the bronze statuette, standing 4 inches (10 cm) tall, known as \u201cDancing Girl\u201d found at Mohenjo-daro in 1926 CE. The piece shows a teenage girl, right hand on her hip, left on her knee, with chin raised as though evaluating the claims of a suitor. An equally impressive piece is a soapstone figure, 6 inches (17 cm) tall, known as the Priest-King, depicting a bearded man wearing a headdress and ornamental armband. Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-daro Joe Ravi (CC BY-SA) A particularly interesting aspect of the artwork is the appearance of what seems to be a unicorn on over 60 percent of the personal seals. There are many different images on these seals but, as Keay notes, the unicorn appears on \"1156 seals and sealings out of a total of 1755 found at Mature Harappan sites\" (17). He also notes that the seals, no matter what image appears on them, also have markings which have been interpreted as Indus Script, suggesting that the \u201cwriting\u201d conveys a meaning different from the image. The \u201cunicorn\u201d could possibly have represented an individual's family, clan, city, or political affiliation and the \u201cwriting\u201d one's personal information. Decline & Aryan Invasion Theory Just as there is no definitive answer to the question of what the seals were, what the \u201cunicorn\u201d represented, or how the people venerated their gods, there is none for why the culture declined and fell. Between c. 1900 - c. 1500 BCE, the cities were steadily abandoned, and the people moved south. As noted, there are a number of theories concerning this, but none are completely satisfactory. According to one, the Gaggar-Hakra River, which is identified with the Sarasvati River from Vedic texts, and which ran adjacent to the Indus River, dried up c. 1900 BCE, necessitating a major relocation of the people who had depended on it. Significant silting at sites such as Mohenjo-daro suggests major flooding which is given as another cause. Priest-king from Mohenjo-daro Mamoon Mengal (CC BY-SA) Another possibility is a drop in necessary trade goods. Both Mesopotamia and Egypt were experiencing troubles during this same time which could have resulted in a significant disruption in trade. The Late Harappan Period corresponds roughly with the Middle Bronze Age in Mesopotamia (2119-1700 BCE) during which the Sumerians \u2013 the major trading partners with the people of the Indus Valley \u2013 were engaged in driving out the Gutian invaders and, between c. 1792-1750 BCE, the Babylonian king Hammurabi was conquering their city-states as he consolidated his empire. In Egypt, the period corresponds to the latter part of the Middle Kingdom (2040-1782 BCE) when the weak 13th Dynasty ruled just prior to the coming of the Hyksos and the central government's loss of power and authority. The reason which early 20th century CE scholars seized on, however, was none of these but the claim that the Indus Valley people had been conquered and driven south by an invasion of a superior race of light-skinned Aryans. Aryan Invasion Theory Western scholars had been translating and interpreting the Vedic literature of India for over 200 years by the time Wheeler was excavating the sites and, in that time, came to develop the theory that the subcontinent was at some point conquered by a light-skinned race known as Aryans who established high culture throughout the land. This theory developed slowly and, at first, innocently through the publication of a work by the Anglo-Welsh philologist Sir William Jones (l. 1746-1794 CE) in 1786 CE. Jones, an avid reader of Sanskrit, noted that there were remarkable similarities between it and European languages and claimed there had to be a common source for all of them; he called this source Proto-Indo-European. Later Western scholars, trying to identify Jones' \u201ccommon source\u201d, concluded that a light-skinned race from the north \u2013 somewhere around Europe \u2013 had conquered the lands south, notably India, establishing culture and spreading their language and customs, even though nothing, objectively, supported this view. A French elitist writer named Joseph Arthur de Gobineau (l. 1816-1882 CE) popularized this view in his work An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races in 1855 CE and asserted that superior, light-skinned, races had \u201cAryan blood\u201d and were naturally disposed to rule over lesser races. The early Iranians self-identified as Aryan, meaning \u201cnoble\u201d or \u201cfree\u201d or \u201ccivilized\u201d, until it was corrupted by European racists to serve their own agenda. Gobineau's book was admired by the German composer Richard Wagner (l. 1813-1883 CE) whose British-born son-in-law, Houston Stewart Chamberlain (l. 1855-1927 CE) further popularized these views in his work which would eventually influence Adolf Hitler and the architect of the Nazi ideology, Alfred Rosenberg (l. 1893-1946 CE). These racialist views were given further validity by a German philologist and scholar who did not share them, Max Muller (l. 1823-1900 CE), the so-called \u201cauthor\u201d of the Aryan Invasion Theory who insisted, in all of his work, that Aryan had to do with a linguistic difference and had nothing at all to do with ethnicity. It hardly mattered what Muller said, however, because, by the time Wheeler was excavating the sites in the 1940s CE, people had been breathing in these theories with the air of the times for well over 50 years. It would be decades more before the majority of scholars, writers, and academics would begin to recognize that 'Aryan' originally referred to a class of people \u2013 having nothing to do with race \u2013 and, in the words of the archaeologist J. P. Mallory, \u201cas an ethnic designation the word [Aryan] is most properly limited to the Indo-Iranians\u201d . The early Iranians self-identified as Aryan meaning \u201cnoble\u201d or \u201cfree\u201d or \u201ccivilized\u201d and the term continued in use for over 2000 years until it was corrupted by European racists to serve their own agenda. Wheeler's interpretation of the sites was informed by and then validated the Aryan Invasion Theory. The Aryans were already recognized as the authors of the Vedas and other works but their dates in the region were too late to support the claim that they had built the impressive cities; perhaps, though, they had destroyed them. Wheeler was, of course, as aware of the Aryan Invasion Theory as any other archaeologist at the time and, through this lens, interpreted what he found as supporting it; in doing so, he validated the theory which then gained greater popularity and acceptance. Conclusion The Aryan Invasion Theory, though still cited and advanced by those with a racialist agenda, lost credence in the 1960s CE through the work, primarily, of the American archaeologist George F. Dales who reviewed Wheeler's interpretations, visited the sites, and found no evidence to support it. The skeletons Wheeler had interpreted as dying a violent death in battle showed no such signs nor did the cities exhibit any damage associated with war. Further, there was no evidence of any kind of mobilization of a great army of the north nor of any conquest c. 1900 BCE in India. The Persians \u2013 the only ethnicity self-identifying as Aryan \u2013 were themselves a minority on the Iranian Plateau between c. 1900 - c. 1500 BCE and in no position to mount an invasion of any kind. It was therefore suggested that the \u201cAryan Invasion\u201d was actually most likely a migration of Indo-Iranians who merged peacefully with the indigenous people of India, intermarried, and were assimilated into the culture. As excavations of the sites of the Indus Valley Civilization continue, more information will no doubt contribute to a better understanding of its history and development. Recognition of the culture's vast accomplishments and high level of technology and sophistication has been increasingly coming to light and gaining greater attention. Scholar Jeffrey D. Long expresses the general sentiment, writing, \u201cthere is much fascination with this civilization because of its high level of technological advancement\u201d (198). Already, the Indus Valley Civilization is referenced as one of the three greatest of antiquity alongside Egypt and Mesopotamia, and future excavations will almost surely elevate its standing even higher.",

Since India gained independence in 1947, the world has changed beyond recognition. From the bipolar world of the U.S. and Soviet Union to a brief unipolar period when American hegemony reigned, to one where China and the United States are moving toward another bipolar competition, distracted by multipolar illusions. In today's chaotic world, India faces the challenge of defining its unique foreign policy identity, and shaping the contours of its engagement to balance the national interest with moral values. What is the Difference Between State and Nation? A State consists of four elements - population, territory, government, and sovereignty. While a Nation is a community based on shared ethnicity, history, traditions, and aspirations. consists of four elements - As a legal entity , the State is responsible for the security and welfare of its people , and it is concerned with external human actions. Whereas Nations are a unit of people who are united emotionally, spiritually, and psychologically. , the is responsible for the security and , and it is concerned with external human actions. The territory is also an essential part of the State , because it is the physical substance of the State. But for a nation, the territory is not an essential part of the nation. A nation can survive without a fixed territory. , because it is the physical substance of the State. In some countries, such as America, Australia and Canada, the state comprises many nations, and they are \u2018multinational societies\u2019. How does India's Foreign Policy Reflect Its Active National Interest? India First Policy: With 75 years of independence, the country has a greater sense of confidence and optimism in articulating an \"India First\" foreign policy . India decides for itself, and its independent foreign policy cannot be subject to intimidations. With one-fifth of the world's population , India has the right to have its own side and to weigh its own interests. It is certainly a basic tenet of international relations that national interests are paramount , and India too, like other nations, has pursued its interests when it comes to foreign and national security policies. With 75 years of independence, the country has a greater sense of confidence and optimism in articulating an . India decides for itself, and its independent foreign policy cannot be subject to intimidations. Realistic Diplomacy: Today\u2019s self-confident India has a new voice in the global firmament, rooted in its domestic realities and civilizational ethos, as well as firm in the pursuit of its vital interests. As the Indian Foreign Minister remarked at Raisina Dialogue , \u201cIt is better to engage with the world on the basis of \u201cwho we are\" rather than try and please the world. India is confident about its identity and priorities, the world will engage with India on its terms. has a new voice in the global firmament, rooted in its and civilizational ethos, as well as firm in the pursuit of its vital interests. Maintaining Balance of Power to its Advantage: From being the only global power to challenge China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative as far back as 2014 to responding to Chinese military aggression with a strong military pushback. On the other hand, working with the US without entering the full embrace of a formal alliance and engaging the West to build domestic capacities. India has been pragmatic to the core and willing to use the extant balance of power to its advantage. From being the as far back as 2014 to Growing Economic Ties: Since India's economic interdependence with the rest of the world deepens, it has become more observant of markets for its products, sources of raw materials , and potential recipients of its expanding foreign aid. Since India's with the rest of the world deepens, it has become more observant of markets for its products, , and potential recipients of its expanding foreign aid. Multi Aligned Approach : From the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to the BRICS , there is a long list of memberships that India holds. Often this is seen as old-style meandering. India, however, is increasingly articulating and promoting its priorities in a much more direct manner. : From the to the , there is a long list of memberships that India holds. Intervention over Interference: India does not believe in interference in the internal affairs of other countries. However, if an act - innocent or deliberate - by any country has the potential of impinging upon India\u2019s national interests, India does not hesitate in quick and timely intervention. What are the Moral Aspects of India\u2019s Foreign Policy? Panchsheel (Five Virtues) : They were formally enunciated in the Agreement on Trade between the Tibet region of China and India signed on April 29, 1954 and later evolved to act as the basis of conduct of international relations globally. These Five Principles are: Mutual respect for each other\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty Mutual non-aggression Mutual non-interference Equality and mutual benefit Peaceful co-existence : They were formally and later evolved to act as the basis of conduct of international relations globally. Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The World is One Family) : It is based on the concept of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas. In other words, India views the entire world community as a single large global family, where members live in harmony, work and grow together, and have trust in one another. : It is based on the concept of Proactive and Impartial Assistance: India does not hesitate in promoting democracy wherever potential exists. This is done by proactively providing assistance in capacity building and strengthening the institutions of democracy, albeit with the explicit consent of the concerned Government. (Ex. Afghanistan). India does not hesitate in promoting democracy wherever potential exists. Global Problem Solving Approach: India advocates a global debate and global consensus on issues of global dimensions such as world trade regime, climate change, terrorism, intellectual property rights, global governance, health hazards. Under the Vaccine diplomacy initiative , India exported 60 million doses, half on commercial terms and 10 million as grants. India advocates a global debate and global consensus on issues of global dimensions such as world trade regime, climate change, terrorism, intellectual property rights, global governance, health hazards. What are the Current Challenges to India\u2019s Foreign Policy? Russia Ukraine Issue: It is certainly a complex international political issue when countries like India find it difficult to choose between politics and moral imperative. Russia is a trade partner, and it has leverage in the Eurasian region, and by going directly against Russia, India will jeopardise its interests in the region. As realist prudence demands, India cannot simply undertake a moralist standpoint on Russia-Ukraine Conflict and ignore the dictates of politics. It is certainly a complex international political issue when countries like India find it difficult to choose between politics and moral imperative. Internal Challenges : A country cannot be powerful abroad if it is weak at home. India\u2019s soft power assets make sense when they are supported by its hard power. Former President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam repeatedly made the case that India can play an effective role on the world stage when it is strong internally as well as externally. : A country cannot be powerful abroad if it is weak at home. Refugee Crisis: In spite of not being a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, India has been one of the largest recipients of refugees in the world. The challenge here is to balance protection of human rights and national interest. As the Rohingya crisis unfolds, there is still a lot that India can do to facilitate the finding of long-term solutions. These actions will be key in determining India\u2019s regional and global standing on human rights. In spite of not being a party to the and its India has been one of the largest recipients of refugees in the world. What Should be the Way Forward? Collective Approach to Tackle Environmental Issues: India has the potential to take the lead in tackling global environmental challenges reflected in its goal of reaching net zero by 2070 (26 th United Nations Conference on Climate Change in 2021) Environmental problems are intertwined with social processes. There is a need for achieving sustainability at social, economic as well as ecological level as highlighted in Sustainable Developement Goals. India has the potential to take the reflected in its Balancing Internal and External Development: India should look forward to creating an external environment which is conducive for an inclusive development of India so that the benefits of growth can reach the poorest of the poor in the country. And ensure that India\u2019s voice is heard on global forums and that India is able to influence world opinion on issues of global dimensions such as terrorism , climate change , disarmament, reforms of institutions of global governance. India should look forward to creating an external environment which is conducive for an of India so that the benefits of growth can reach the poorest of the poor in the country. Pouring Ethical Values in Foreign Policy : As rightly said by Mahatma Gandhi, politics without principles and ethics would be disastrous . India should move towards collective development with an ethical persuasion reclaiming its moral leadership in the world at large. : As rightly said by . India should move towards reclaiming its moral leadership in the world at large. Policy Evolution Along with Maintaining Basic Principles : We are living in a dynamic world. India\u2019s foreign policy is therefore geared up to be proactive, flexible as well as pragmatic so as to make quick adjustments to respond to evolving situations. In the implementation of its foreign policy India , however, invariably adheres to a set of basic principles on which no compromise is made securing: National Beliefs & Values National Interests National Strategy : We are living in a dynamic world. India\u2019s foreign policy is therefore geared up to be proactive, flexible as well as pragmatic so as to make quick adjustments to respond to evolving situations. Shaping the Global Agenda: It is important for India to trace the role of a \u201cleading power\" in the international system, one that shapes global norms and institutional architecture, rather than these being shaped by others. To this is linked the aspiration to be a Permanent Member of the expanded UN Security Council for which a large number of countries have already pledged support. of a in the international system, Diplomacy for Development: In order to sustain its growth trajectory, India needs substantial external inputs. To succeed, our on-going programmes such as Make in India , Skill India , Smart Cities , infrastructure development , Digital India , Clean India etc. need foreign partners , Foreign Direct Investments , financial assistance and transfer of technology. India\u2019s foreign policy should add focus on this aspect of Diplomacy For Development by integrating economic diplomacy with political diplomacy. In order to sustain its growth trajectory, India needs substantial external inputs.

The country has witnessed an incredible transformation in the last few decades, and it is all thanks to the efforts of the government, businesses, and people. The digital revolution in India has created an ecosystem that is transforming the country, driving growth and innovation in all sectors. In this article, we will delve into the reasons why India has become a global leader in the digital revolution and how it is impacting the country. Overview of the Digital Revolution in India The digital revolution in India started in the 1990s, with the advent of computers and the internet. However, it was not until the early 2000s that the digital revolution really took off in the country. This was when the government started to focus on building a robust IT infrastructure, and businesses began to leverage technology to enhance their operations. Today, India is home to some of the world\u2019s leading technology companies, and the country has emerged as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. One of the significant drivers of the digital revolution in India has been the government\u2019s focus on technology. The government has launched several initiatives to promote digitalization in the country, including the Digital India program. The program aims to create a digital infrastructure that will enable every citizen to access government services and information online. Additionally, the government has launched several schemes to promote digital literacy, such as the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA), which aims to make one person in every rural household digitally literate. Another critical driver of the digital revolution in India has been the rise of startups. India is home to some of the world\u2019s most successful startups, such as Flipkart, Paytm, and Ola. These companies have leveraged technology to disrupt traditional industries and create new markets. They have also created a startup ecosystem that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship. The government has launched several initiatives to support startups, such as the Startup India program, which provides funding, mentorship, and other support to startups. mentorship, and other support to startups.

The country produces over 1.5 million engineering graduates every year, and a significant percentage of them have IT-related skills. The talent pool in India is one of the primary reasons why the country has become a global leader in the digital revolution. The availability of skilled workers has enabled Indian companies to develop cutting-edge technologies and compete on a global scale. Cost-Effective Solutions: One of the significant advantages of the Indian IT industry is its cost-effectiveness. The cost of labor in India is much lower than in developed countries like the US and the UK. This has made it possible for Indian companies to offer cost-effective solutions to their clients. Many global companies outsource their IT work to India, which has helped to fuel the growth of the Indian IT industry. The cost-effectiveness of Indian IT companies has also enabled them to compete with global players and win contracts.

                "text": "It's impossible to have a conversation about health and wellness without talking about mental health. In the United States, nearly one in five adults have a mental illness or mental health condition. That's nearly 52 million people. However, mental health isn't just about having or not having a mental illness. Our well-being is affected by all aspects of our lives, and that, in turn, affects how we experience life, work, and time with our loved ones. Now, the conversation is more critical than ever. In 2021, the prevalent feeling of the year was languishing. BetterUp\u2019s research found that more than 55% of workers weren't mentally ill, but they weren't thriving either. As the pandemic has brought physical health center stage in an unprecedented way, it's time to look at the other major components of well-being. The conversation around mental health awareness has never been as public, as prevalent, or as important. After all, building awareness is a critical ingredient to learning how to care for your mental health. Learn what mental health awareness is and how it makes a difference in your personal and professional life in this article. What is mental health awareness? So what does mental health awareness mean, and how do you promote it? Mental health awareness is the ongoing effort to reduce the stigma around mental illness and mental health conditions by sharing our personal experiences. Often, because of misconceptions about mental health and mental fitness, people often suffer in silence and their conditions go untreated. Mental health awareness is an important social movement to both improve understanding and increase access to healthcare. How can mental health awareness help? Mental health awareness is critical to promoting mental health treatment and behavioral health. It\u2019s a necessary and foundational conversation for changing to a more proactive model of mental health. Right now, we only fill our tanks when they\u2019re on \u201cempty.\u201d Developing our awareness helps us start to recognize the signs and symptoms when we\u2019re feeling \u201coff\u201d \u2014 just as we do with physical illness. Here are four important benefits of mental health awareness: 1. Helps you understand your symptoms Sometimes, there is magic in having a diagnosis. Despite the stigma around the term, it\u2019s simply a shorthand for a collection of symptoms that occur together. Especially with mental health conditions, which are difficult to pinpoint \u2014 and sometimes impossible to find \u2014 on a test, a diagnosis can be incredibly validating. It can help people feel less alone and make it easier to find treatment. Pay attention to your symptoms. For example, you might feel like your mental health worsens with social media use. 2. Starts a conversation Mental health awareness is an ongoing conversation, but up until recently, it's only been had in whispers. But because a common feature of many moods and anxiety disorders is distorted thinking, talking about it can actually be immensely therapeutic. Building a support network and speaking with a licensed mental health professional is critical to alleviating symptoms of many mental health conditions. Unfortunately, stigma creates silence. It also makes it difficult to ask for support at work or in other environments that might be made more challenging by a mental health diagnosis. 3. Better education It's crucial for caregivers, employers, parents, family members, and loved ones to understand the impact that mental health has on daily life. However, while mental health conditions can make daily life more difficult, they also don't have to prevent you from having a fulfilling and engaging life. When the people in your life understand and prioritize mental health care, it makes it easier to take the actions you need to do to take care of yourself and thrive. 4. Promotes mental fitness Many of us have fallen into the trap of thinking of mental health as solely related to mental illness. However, it's possible to have a mental health condition and be mentally fit, and the absence of a mental health condition doesn't necessarily ensure mental fitness. Expanding our understanding of mental health issues and wellness to incorporate mental fitness, a proactive approach to emotional health, well-being, and cognitive agility. It allows us to live life with more purpose, clarity, and passion. Reducing the stigma around mental health is an important step to embracing mental fitness. 3 tips to promote mental health awareness How can individual people, especially non-clinicians, make a difference in promoting mental health awareness? A big part of it is learning to talk and share about mental health openly. When we are quiet about mental health and fitness, we allow stigma to continue. That silence makes it harder for people to prioritize their own mental well-being. Here are several ideas to promote mental health awareness within your community. Speak up for yourself How often do you see someone take a mental health day? And how often do you see them being honest about it? Many of us feel like our physical well-being is more important than our mental well-being. We take a day off when we're sick, but not when we're feeling emotionally drained or exhausted. The next time you take time off, be honest with your team that you're taking the time for your mental well-being. When you participate in self-advocacy for your mental health, you're empowering others to do the same. You'll likely inspire others to do the same. Learn more about mental health Take the time to learn about mental health and mental fitness. But beyond that, learn how to differentiate the two. Learn about common mental health conditions, signs of burnout, and how to take care of yourself when you're experiencing symptoms. It can be helpful to keep an eye on your own warning signs to know when you're starting to get triggered or overwhelmed. If you find resources that may benefit others, share them with those around you. Talk to a coach One of my favorite things about working for BetterUp is that every person here has a coach. Whether I'm talking to a manager, a colleague, someone in another department, or an executive, it's common for us to share stories or insights from our coaching sessions. At BetterUp, we truly have a culture of personal development and mental fitness. It's perfectly acceptable to take time for the Inner Work\u00ae that makes our outer work sustainable and more successful. Why is mental health awareness so important? Mental health isn't just a conversation for people dealing with mental health disorders. It impacts our social, emotional, physical, and cognitive well-being. Unfortunately, many people don't receive the treatment that they need because of the stigma associated with mental health. Some don't even realize that treatment is available. When these people suffer quietly, they feel lonely and disenfranchised. We miss out on their brilliance. Every year, suicide is one of the top three causes of death in the United States. And it's been on the rise in recent years. This is true for all economic classes, ethnicities, and genders, although some groups are at a markedly higher risk. Every suicide is a tragedy. Death by suicide comes at a high cost. Not only does it warrant financial losses it\u2019s, more importantly, devastating for the survivors of the person who died. We never truly know how our actions impact another person, but if raising awareness can save a life, it is a truly worthwhile endeavor. Additional mental health resources You don\u2019t have to do it alone. Organizations and resources are here (and waiting) to help. Lean on the mental health providers below for support \u2014 or pass them along to a loved one who might be struggling. You can also find support groups that might help to connect with people living with shared experiences. For example, some support groups specialize in certain conditions like schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. As always, consult your doctor or trained mental health professional as well. It\u2019s important to keep your medical team informed of how you\u2019re feeling. Your overall health and well-being is critically important."

                "text": "What is sustainable fashion and why is it so important The world is becoming more eco-conscious, especially with apparel. Sustainable fashion has been slowly building over the past decade, and now it looks set to explode. This means a lot of changes in the industry, from packaging to consumer spending. Is your business ready? What does sustainable fashion mean? Sustainable fashion is a way in which brands create clothing that not only reduces the impact on the environment but is also mindful of the people who work to produce the garments. Put simply, it is fashion that is ethically made and environmentally friendly. All this sounds simple, however, being sustainable means more overheads, which in turn reduces profit margins. For the industry to become sustainable as a whole, consumers must be willing to pay more to help make the change, or at the very least, stop buying from brands that have no regard for the environment. This change in the zeitgeist looks like it\u2019s beginning to happen, as younger, more eco-conscious consumers become more influential in marketing demographics. Examples of sustainable fashion Apparel brands can break their sustainable practices down into four areas. Ethical Fashion: This covers production, working conditions and Fair Trade practices. Ethical fashion is a moralistic stance a company takes to ensure no human beings or animals are hurt due to their manufacturing practices. Circular Fashion: This is an off-shoot of the circular economy, and advocates that all materials and products in society are used and circulated among people for as long as possible, in an environmentally safe, effective and fair manner. This encompasses things like recycling, upcycling, and thrifting. Slow Fashion: Slow fashion is the antithesis of Fast Fashion, taking a long-term view and considering the whole product lifecycle. This includes sharing or renting clothes as well as the quality of garments to help them last longer and thus reduce the need to buy new ones. Conscious Fashion: This is more of a message to get across to consumers, explaining and encouraging them to buy eco-friendly products and get behind the green fashion movement. Why sustainable fashion is important The fashion industry is incredibly harmful to the planet. Second only to oil, the industry is one of the world\u2019s largest polluters, responsible for 20% of global industrial water pollution. It comes as a surprise to many that most clothes are actually made out of plastic, creating a microplastic disaster in the making. Add to that the thousands of harmful chemicals used in the textile mills around the world, which are dangerous to both the environment and the people working with them, and the time has come for a global change in the industry. That change must come in the form of sustainable fashion. How we can help you become more sustainable We strongly believe that a greener, more environmentally-friendly business practice is not only important for the planet, but also for a business\u2019 future success. As the fashion industry moves towards sustainability, there are a lot of big changes ahead for businesses, changes we can help with. A commitment to sustainability shouldn\u2019t just be buzzwords and vague slogans, which is why we are 100% committed to renewable, ethical, and eco-friendly practices. With decades of experience in the industry, we work together with our clients, manufacturers and distributors to ensure a fair and sustainable practice for everyone. Adapting to the new sustainable model can be challenging, but there is also a lot of potential room for growth. We have experience, contacts and resources at every stage of the production chain, from the ethical treatment of workers to packaging materials. If your company needs help with making environmental and sustainable changes, then contact us today and let\u2019s have a chat about how we can help you prepare for the future."

Information from the latest month between May and August 2023 for which food price inflation data are available shows high inflation in many low- and middle-income countries, with inflation higher than 5% in 52.6% of low-income countries, 86% of lower-middle-income countries, and 64% of upper-middle-income countries and many experiencing double-digit inflation. In addition, 73.2% of high-income countries are experiencing high food price inflation. The most-affected countries are in Africa, North America, Latin America, South Asia, Europe, and Central Asia. In real terms, food price inflation exceeded overall inflation (measured as year-on-year change in the overall consumer price index) in 81% of the 162 countries for which food CPI and overall CPI indexes are both available. Download the latest brief on rising food insecurity and World Bank responses Since the last update on July 27, the agriculture and cereal price indices closed 6% and 10% lower, respectively, while the export price index closed at the same level. The decline in cereal price index has been driven by maize and wheat prices, which are 13% and 24% lower, respectively, since the last update. On a year-on-year basis, maize and wheat prices are also 28% and 31% lower. However, rice prices continue their rising trend since May and are 31% higher. Compared to January 2021, maize prices are 6% lower, wheat prices are 12% lower, while rice prices are 16% higher. (See \u201cpink sheet\u201d data for agricultural commodity and food commodity prices indices, updated monthly.) The September 2023 edition of the Agricultural Market Information System Market Monitor highlights recent developments in agricultural commodity markets, which have been dominated by India's export restrictions on rice and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Wheat prices continue to face downward pressure from abundant Black Sea exports prior to the termination of the agreement, and the termination of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and Russian attacks on Ukrainian export facilities have increased market volatility, although prospects for global soybean and maize production this year are positive, with some stock rebuilding expected despite dry conditions in Argentina, parts of Europe, and North America. India announced bans on non-basmati white rice exports on July 20, 2023, and further restrictions on basmati rice exports on August 27, 2023, causing disruption and price spikes in rice markets. The Market Monitor highlights recent surges in agricultural input prices, particularly those linked to fossil fuel\u2013based energy sources such as mineral fertilizers, and related concerns about global food security. In the upcoming 2023-24 season, the global grain market is poised for improvement, primarily due to record-level production of three staple grains: wheat, maize, and rice. Record-high production of wheat is forecasted, which can be attributed to various factors: Argentina is recovering from a severe drought, which had hampered its wheat output; Canada anticipates near-record wheat production; and substantial harvests are expected in China, the European Union, and India. These combined conditions are expected to result in unprecedented global wheat production. Maize production is also forecasted to reach record levels in 2023/24. The driving forces include expected increases in production in Argentina, China, the European Union, and the United States. Pakistan is expected to recover from a poor harvest season for rice caused by extreme flooding, but India, which had been a significant contributor to global rice exports, has imposed a ban on non-basmati rice exports. This ban, accounting for nearly half of India's rice exports, has tightened global rice supplies, affecting the overall dynamics of the market. Despite these restrictions, it is anticipated that global grain supplies will grow by approximately 60 million tonnes in 2023/24, slightly exceeding long-term average annual growth. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) describes the varying regional impacts of the El Ni\u00f1o's phenomenon. In East Africa, the El Ni\u00f1o-induced above-average rainfall presents a mixed blessing. While it can aid in recovering from ongoing drought conditions and boost crop and livestock production, it also brings the risk of heavy rainfall, flooding, and landslides, particularly in areas like eastern Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and southern Uganda. In Asia and the Pacific, the effects of El Ni\u00f1o vary across the region, impacting agriculture and food security differently. Southeast Asian countries anticipate drought-related losses in key cereal crops, pulses, and cash crops, as well as threats to the aquaculture sector from saltwater intrusion. Livestock mortality is expected due to higher temperatures and water scarcity. In Latin America and the Caribbean, El Ni\u00f1o's impacts include delays in planting, crop losses, and livestock challenges in countries like Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Central American nations, Peru, and Venezuela. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, trade-related policies imposed by countries have surged. The global food crisis has been partially made worse by the growing number of food trade restrictions put in place by countries with a goal of increasing domestic supply and reducing prices. As of September 11, 2023, 19 countries have implemented 27 food export bans, and 7 have implemented 12 export-limiting measures. World Bank Action As part of a comprehensive, global response to the food security crisis, in April 2022 the World Bank announced that it is making up to $30 billion available over a period of 15 months, including $12 billion in new projects. The financing is to scale up short- and long-term responses along four themes to boost food and nutrition security, reduce risks, and strengthen food systems: (i) support producers and consumers, (ii) facilitate increased trade in food and trade inputs, (iii) support vulnerable households, and (iv) invest in sustainable food and nutrition security. The Bank has now surpassed its target of $30 billion commitment for food and nutrition security response. Some examples include: In May 2022, the World Bank Group and the G7 Presidency co-convened the Global Alliance for Food Security, which aims to catalyze an immediate and concerted response to the unfolding global hunger crisis. The Alliance has developed the publicly accessible Global Food and Nutrition Security Dashboard, which provides timely information for global and local decision-makers to help improve coordination of the policy and financial response to the food crisis. The heads of the FAO, IMF, World Bank Group, WFP, and WTO released a Third Joint Statement on February 8, 2023. The statement calls to prevent a worsening of the food and nutrition security crisis, further urgent actions are required to (i) rescue hunger hotspots, (ii) facilitate trade, improve the functioning of markets, and enhance the role of the private sector, and (iii) reform and repurpose harmful subsidies with careful targeting and efficiency. Countries should balance short-term urgent interventions with longer-term resilience efforts as they respond to the crisis. Last Updated: Sep 18, 2023"
