Airline sector poised for change post-COVID-19': [], '': [], '1. Leisure trips will fuel the recovery': ['Business travel will take longer to recover, and even then, we estimate it will only likely recover to around 80 percent of prepandemic levels by 2024. Remote work\xa0and other flexible working arrangements are likely to remain in some form postpandemic and people will take fewer corporate trips.', 'In previous crises, leisure trips or visits to friends and relatives tended to rebound first, as was the case in the United Kingdom following 9/11 and the global financial crisis (Exhibit 1). Not only did business trips take four years to return to precrisis levels after the attacks on the World Trade Center but they also had not yet recovered to pre-financial-crisis levels when COVID-19 broke out in 2020. Therefore, we expect that as the pandemic subsides, the rise in leisure trips will outpace the recovery of business travel.', 'Some carriers are highly dependent on business travelers—both those traveling in business class and those who book economy-class seats right before they need to travel. While leisure passengers fill up most of the seats on flights and help cover a portion of fixed costs, their overall financial contributions in net marginal terms are negligible, if not negative. Most of the profits earned on a long-haul flight are generated by a small group of high-yielding passengers, often traveling for business. But this pool of profit-generating passengers has shrunk because of the pandemic.', 'Airlines should reevaluate the economics of their operations, especially long-haul flights. First, a smaller contribution from business traffic could necessitate a different pricing logic. For example, today most carriers price point-to-point nonstop flights at a premium. Travelers who value time over price—mostly business travelers—book these nonstop flights. Leisure travelers, even those traveling in premium classes, are more price sensitive and may choose an indirect routing. This large gap between nonstop pricing and connect pricing may need to narrow.', 'Second, lower business traffic may require network changes. Airlines added many flights over the past few years between hubs and smaller cities, using small-size widebodies such as the Boeing 787. These flights work because of the high-yielding business demand. With business demand subdued, economics favor larger aircraft flying less frequently. Airlines may find that larger aircraft such as Airbus A350s or Boeing 777s—which have lower unit costs—become the base of the long-haul network.', 'Third, airlines may also look at reconfiguring the layout of their cabins to address the increased share of leisure traffic. At the simplest level, lower business-class demand may warrant smaller business-class cabins. Taking this further, products may shift to better cater to premium-leisure passengers, such as growth of premium-economy cabins or development of business-class seats more suitable for traveling as couples or groups.', 'Many airlines have had to borrow huge sums of money to stay afloat and cope with high daily cash burn rates. Tapping into state-provided aid, credit lines, and bond issuances, the industry collectively amassed more than $180 billion worth of debt in 2020,1“COVID-19 lowers airline credit ratings and raises the cost of debt,” International Air Transport Association, August 21, 2020, iata.org. a figure equivalent to more than half of total annual revenues that year. And debt levels are still rising (Exhibit 2). Repaying these loans is made even harder by worsening credit ratings and higher financing costs.', 'These costs will need to be recouped. Therefore, we’ll likely see ticket prices rise. By our estimates, this could amount to a rise in ticket prices of about 3 percent, assuming a ten-year repayment window for only the additional debt taken on.', 'Furthermore, when demand for air travel returns, it will likely outpace supply initially. We see a glut of latent demand of people eager to travel. It will take time for airlines to restore capacity, and bottlenecks such as delays in bringing aircraft back to service and crew retraining could lead to a supply–demand gap, resulting in higher short-term prices.', 'In many cases, airline rescue efforts come in the form of government bailouts—with strings attached. We’re seeing a reemergence of, or increase in, the level of state ownership and influence. In Europe alone, TAP Air Portugal, Lufthansa Group, and Air Baltic all received state aid combined with an increase or reintroduction of government shareholdings.', 'As the state becomes a more active player—whether as a creditor, a direct shareholder, or as part of the board—airlines will find themselves having to deal more closely with the authorities. Instead of seeing this as a necessary restriction to access much-needed funds, airlines can treat it as an opportunity to shape how the sector evolves with a key stakeholder.', 'Airlines can work with regulators to set standards across a gamut of issues. These could include committing to reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions in return for more labor flexibility; increasing the cash-on-hand requirements to make airlines more resilient against future shocks; more balanced value sharing between airlines and other sectors such as airports; or changes in the ownership caps to allow greater inflows of foreign capital, reducing the reliance on state capital further down the road.', 'Some airlines have responded to the pandemic by restructuring for greater efficiency; others are merely muddling through. Occasionally, this is linked to state-aid programs, which may reduce the incentive for much-needed measures such as cost, organizational, and operational restructuring. Airlines that are not proactively transforming risk failing to set the business up for longer-term structural value creation.', 'As such, we’re seeing some airlines pull ahead. Before COVID-19, an airline boasted an ROIC well ahead of the overall industry’s rate of 5.8 percent. Not only did its stronger position pre-COVID-19 enable it to navigate the crisis thus far without taking on government loans of the scale relative to other airlines, it also made it possible for it to restructure to emerge with an even more competitive cost base.', 'Another group of carriers that have an opportunity to transform their business are airlines that have access to a restructuring process, such as Chapter 11 in the United States. These carriers can renegotiate midlife leases, shed excess debt, and emerge leaner. They will be fierce competitors going forward.', 'Becoming better can necessitate investment. Even though many airlines find themselves in financial straits, we recommend investing more in IT and digitalization, not less. Before the pandemic, airlines spent roughly 5 percent of their revenue on IT. This is relatively low compared with other sectors. By means of comparison, the retail industry spends around 6 percent on average, and financial services 10 percent.', 'Airlines could consider stepping up IT and automation investment now. For example, airlines can respond to the quicker recovery of domestic and short-haul flights by investing in direct sales and owning the customer relationship. Relationships with IT and distribution providers could be reexplored. Carriers can also invest in the customer experience—such as making check-in and boarding processes more seamless—and support services—from revenue accounting to invoicing—to drive the next level of efficiency. Beyond this, the next horizon is analytics, which involves, among other efforts, using data\xa0in smarter ways to enhance decision making, requiring some investment but yielding significant payoffs.', 'In the years before COVID-19, aircraft OEMs ramped up production in the anticipation of continued growth. This has led to a glut in aircraft availability. Furthermore, some carriers have returned relatively new aircraft to lessors, such as Norwegian Air Shuttle when it exited the long-haul market. Prices for used-aircraft leases have plummeted and are likely to remain lower. For instance, the monthly lease rate of a 2016 vintage Boeing 777-300ER aircraft was around $1.2 million in 2019. In 2020, the rate fell to less than $800,000. New aircraft are rumored to be available at even deeper discounts.', 'If finances permit, carriers can consider acting countercyclically: locking in orders for new aircraft or confirming operating leases now when demand is low. Aircraft are a significant expense for an airline, making up 10 to 15 percent of a carrier’s cost base. As lease rates and OEM pricing fluctuate with supply and demand levels, inking deals during a crisis could allow carriers to enjoy a cost advantage for years to come.', 'Over the past ten years, low cargo rates and the unprofitability of the cargo business have led many airlines to relinquish or scale back their dedicated cargo freighter fleets. However, cargo has been a lifeline for the aviation industry during COVID-19. Before the pandemic, cargo typically made up around 12 percent of the sector’s total revenue; that percentage tripled last year. Based on data from the Airline Analyst, only 21 (down from 77 in 2019) of the airlines around the world that disclosed their operating performance achieved positive operating profits for the third quarter of 2020, traditionally the industry’s most profitable quarter.

Airlines can enhance their flexibility through measures such as increasing the deployment of so-called preighters, or passenger airplanes that are used to transport cargo. Airlines may look at freighter conversions, especially as their passenger fleets reduce in number.', 'Airlines need to be agile. Rushing headlong into developing and maintaining a large freighter fleet again comes with risk. Airlines need to grow cargo in an agile way that allows for quick adjustments; pursuing such a play should be seen as part of a wider theme of establishing a more flexible production setup.

There is some relief to be found in various parts of the world now that vaccinations have begun, but the road to recovery for air traffic will take several years. The shape of the post-COVID-19 airline sector is becoming clearer and holds lessons for airlines today.

The precise features and services provided to guests can vary quite drastically from one hotel to another. Hotel owners aim to attract a particular type of customer through their pricing model and marketing strategy or via the range of services they offer.', 'Next, it is important to answer the question: what is the hotel industry? Put simply, the hotel industry is the section of the service industry that deals with guest accommodation or lodgings. By most definitions, the hotel industry refers to hotels and many other forms of overnight accommodation, including hostels, motels, inns, and guest houses. However, it does not usually include long-term or permanent forms of accommodation.', 'Due to the nature of hotel services, it is closely associated with the travel and tourism industry.', 'One common area of confusion concerns the difference between the hotel and the hospitality industry, with many people mistakenly believing the two terms refer to the same thing. However, while there is a cross-over, the difference is that the hospitality industry is broader in scope and includes multiple different sectors.', 'The hotel industry is solely concerned with providing guest accommodation and related services. By contrast, the hospitality industry is concerned with leisure in a more general sense. As a result, it covers accommodation, restaurants, bars, cafés, nightlife, and many travel and tourism services.', 'It is important to understand that the hotel industry is a catch-all term to describe guest accommodation services. With that in mind, it is worth noting that a variety of different accommodation types fall under this umbrella term. Some of the main types are described in more detail below:', 'The most common type of accommodation in the hotel industry, a hotel is defined as an establishment that offers overnight accommodation, meals and other services. They are mainly aimed at travelers or tourists, although locals may also use them. Hotels provide private rooms and almost always have en-suite bathrooms.', 'Bed and breakfasts, or B&Bs, are smaller establishments offering guests private rooms for overnight stays and breakfast in the morning. Often, these establishments are converted from private homes, and many B&B owners live on their property. While they are often a budget option, high-end or luxury B&Bs exist.', 'Motels are a form of overnight accommodation tailored towards motorists. For this reason, they are typically located conveniently by the roadside and offer ample free parking. A motel will generally have a number of guest rooms and may have some additional facilities but will usually have fewer amenities than hotels.', '‘Botel’ is the name given to a boat that has been adapted to offer hotel-style lodgings. Many botels are permanently moored riverboats, although others are converted ships, which can travel with guests onboard. They are especially popular in European cities with rivers or canals.', 'An inn is an establishment that provides temporary accommodation, usually along with food and drinks. Inns are smaller than hotels and are closer in size to bed and breakfasts, although inns are often slightly larger. Guests are allocated private rooms; food options usually include breakfast and dinner.', 'Resorts are commercial establishments, usually consisting of a hotel and a variety of on-site services and amenities. Guests will usually have access to lodgings, restaurants, bars, entertainment options, recreational activities, and shops, which can all be accessed without leaving the premises.', 'Popular among business travelers, serviced apartments are apartment-style lodgings, where guests benefit from a full range of services, such as room service, housekeeping and laundry services. Most serviced apartments also offer additional amenities, while the apartments tend to be larger than most hotel rooms.', 'Often confused with hostels, a hostal is a form of accommodation primarily found in Spanish-speaking regions. They resemble a budget hotel, offering either private bedrooms or apartments, while they may also have a bar, restaurant and/or café. Most hostals are family-owned, and guests may sometimes share bathrooms with others.', 'A hostel is a form of accommodation, typically aimed at those on a budget, where multiple guests sleep in different beds in the same living space. Effectively, guests pay for a bed, rather than a private room, and hostels hold a particular appeal for those looking to meet new people. Guests will usually share kitchen and bathroom facilities.', 'An apartment hotel is essentially an apartment building that operates hotel-style services. It provides a similar experience to renting an apartment, albeit with the option to check-in and check out on-demand rather than signing a fixed-term contract. These hotels will generally also provide basic housekeeping services.', 'Often promoted based on aspiration and luxury, boutique hotels are hotels situated within relatively small buildings. In most instances, they provide guests with upmarket rooms and high-quality services. They often have a particular theme and are commonly found in trendy urban areas.', 'A condo hotel is a condominium building that operates as a hotel, allowing guests to rent a condominium unit for a short period. They are almost exclusively found in cities, are especially popular in the United States, and combine the holiday home experience with hotel-style service features.', 'The basic definition of an eco-hotel is a hotel, which has taken steps to embrace sustainable living practices to minimize the environmental damage they are responsible for. They may prioritize the use of local products, adopt recycling measures, focus on energy saving, and use sustainable bed linen and towels.', 'Typically, a guest house is a private house, which has been converted to provide guest lodgings. It is common for the guest area to be kept completely separate from another area, where the owner may live. Some guesthouses provide additional services, but many are operated on a self-service basis.', 'A holiday cottage, also known as a holiday home, is simply a cottage or small house left to people temporarily for holiday purposes. Essentially, a guest pays to use the property for a short period of time. They are especially common in the UK, US, and Canada, and a key advantage is the freedom they offer guests.', 'Pensions are a form of the guest house, similar to bed and breakfasts, while providing more meals throughout the day. In most cases, guests have an option of different plans, such as full board, where they get breakfast, lunch, and dinner, or half board, where they may get breakfast and dinner, without the lunch.', 'A pop-up hotel is a name given to a hotel that is housed within a non-permanent structure. Typically, pop-up hotels exist for a short period of time only. They are most commonly associated with outdoor events, but pop-up hotels may also be established for a particular time of year, such as Christmas or the summer.', 'Finally, roadhouses are relatively small establishments situated next to a road to attract passing customers. In some ways, they combine the features of a motel, B&B, and inn. They often offer several private guest rooms, similar to a B&B, and may also have a restaurant and/or a bar.', '', 'Within the hotel industry, star ratings are used to measure the quality of hotels.

Indirect Tax Law Explained': [], '1. What is GST in India?': ['GST is known as the Goods and Services Tax. It is an indirect tax which has replaced many indirect taxes in India such as the excise duty, VAT, services tax, etc. The Goods and Service Tax Act was passed in the Parliament on 29th March 2017 and came into effect on 1st July 2017.', 'In other words,Goods and Service Tax (GST) is levied on the supply of goods and services. Goods and Services Tax Law in India is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax that is levied on every value addition. GST is a single domestic indirect tax law for the entire country.', 'Before the Goods and Services Tax could be introduced, the structure of indirect tax levy in India was as follows:', '', 'Under the GST regime, the tax is levied at every point of sale. In the case of intra-state sales, Central GST and State GST are charged. All the inter-state sales are chargeable to the Integrated GST.', 'Now, let us understand the definition of Goods and Service Tax, as mentioned above, in detail.', 'An item goes through multiple change-of-hands along its supply chain: Starting from manufacture until the final sale to the consumer.', 'Let us consider the following stages:', '\xa0', 'The Goods and Services Tax is levied on each of these stages making it a multi-stage tax.', '', 'A manufacturer who makes biscuits buys flour, sugar and other material. The value of the inputs increases when the sugar and flour are mixed and baked into biscuits.', 'The manufacturer then sells these biscuits to the warehousing agent who packs large quantities of biscuits in cartons and labels it. This is another addition of value to the biscuits. After this, the warehousing agent sells it to the retailer.', 'The retailer packages the biscuits in smaller quantities and invests in the marketing of the biscuits, thus increasing its value. GST is levied on these value additions, i.e. the monetary value added at each stage to achieve the final sale to the end customer.', 'Consider goods manufactured in Maharashtra and sold to the final consumer in Karnataka. Since the Goods and Service Tax is levied at the point of consumption, the entire tax revenue will go to Karnataka and not Maharashtra.', 'The GST journey began in the year 2000 when a committee was set up to draft law. It took 17 years from then for the Law to evolve. In 2017, the GST Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. On 1st July 2017, the GST Law came into force.', '', 'GST has replaced multiple indirect taxes, which were existing under the previous tax regime. The advantage of having one single tax means every state follows the same rate for a particular product or service. Tax administration is easier with the Central Government deciding the rates and policies. Common laws can be introduced, such as e-way bills for goods transport and e-invoicing for transaction reporting. Tax compliance is also better as taxpayers are not bogged down with multiple return forms and deadlines. Overall, it’s a unified system of indirect tax compliance.', 'India had several erstwhile indirect taxes such as service tax, Value Added Tax (VAT), Central Excise, etc., which used to be levied at multiple supply chain stages. Some taxes were governed by the states and some by the Centre. There was no unified and centralised tax on both goods and services. Hence, GST was introduced. Under GST, all the major indirect taxes were subsumed into one. It has greatly reduced the compliance burden on taxpayers and eased tax administration for the government.', 'One of the primary objectives of GST was to remove the cascading effect of taxes. Previously, due to different indirect tax laws, taxpayers could not set off the tax credits of one tax against the other. For example, the excise duties paid during manufacture could not be set off against the VAT payable during the sale. This led to a cascading effect of taxes. Under GST, the tax levy is only on the net value added at each stage of the supply chain. This has helped eliminate the cascading effect of taxes and contributed to the seamless flow of input tax credits across both goods and services.', 'GST laws in India are far more stringent compared to any of the erstwhile indirect tax laws. Under GST, taxpayers can claim an input tax credit only on invoices uploaded by their respective suppliers. This way, the chances of claiming input tax credits on fake invoices are minimal. The introduction of e-invoicing has further reinforced this objective. Also, due to GST being a nationwide tax and having a centralised surveillance system, the clampdown on defaulters is quicker and far more efficient. Hence, GST has curbed tax evasion and minimised tax fraud from taking place to a large extent.', 'GST has helped in widening the tax base in India. Previously, each of the tax laws had a different threshold limit for registration based on turnover. As GST is a consolidated tax levied on both goods and services both, it has increased tax-registered businesses. Besides, the stricter laws surrounding input tax credits have helped bring certain unorganised sectors under the tax net. For example, the construction industry in India.', 'Previously, taxpayers faced a lot of hardships dealing with different tax authorities under each tax law. Besides, while return filing was online, most of the assessment and refund procedures took place offline. Now, GST procedures are carried out almost entirely online. Everything is done with a click of a button, from registration to return filing to refunds to e-way bill generation. It has contributed to the overall ease of doing business in India and simplified taxpayer compliance to a massive extent. The government also plans to introduce a centralised portal soon for all indirect tax compliance such as e-invoicing, e-way bills and GST return filing.', 'A single indirect tax system reduces the need for multiple documentation for the supply of goods. GST minimises transportation cycle times, improves supply chain and turnaround time, and leads to warehouse consolidation, among other benefits. With the e-way bill system under GST, the removal of interstate checkpoints is most beneficial to the sector in improving transit and destination efficiency. Ultimately, it helps in cutting down the high logistics and warehousing costs.', 'Introducing GST has also led to an increase in consumption and indirect tax revenues. Due to the cascading effect of taxes under the previous regime, the prices of goods in India were higher than in global markets. Even between states, the lower VAT rates in certain states led to an imbalance of purchases in these states. Having uniform GST rates have contributed to overall competitive pricing across India and on the global front. This has hence increased consumption and led to higher revenues, which has been another important objective achieved.', 'GST has mainly removed the cascading effect on the sale of goods and services. Removal of the cascading effect has impacted the cost of goods. Since the GST regime eliminates the tax on tax, the cost of goods decreases.', 'Also, GST is mainly technologically driven. All the activities like registration, return filing, application for refund and response to notice needs to be done online on the GST portal, which accelerates the processes.', '', 'There are three taxes applicable under this system: CGST, SGST & IGST.', 'In most cases, the tax structure under the new regime will be as follows:', 'In such a case, the dealer has to charge IGST of Rs.9,000. This revenue will go to Central Government.', 'The dealer has to collect Rs.6,000 as Goods and Service Tax, Rs.3,000 will go to the Central Government and Rs.3,000 will go to the Gujarat government since the sale is within the state.', 'In the earlier indirect tax regime, there were many indirect taxes levied by both the state and the centre. States mainly collected taxes in the form of Value Added Tax (VAT). Every state had a different set of rules and regulations.', 'Inter-state sale of goods was taxed by the centre. CST (Central State Tax) was applicable in case of inter-state sale of goods. The indirect taxes such as the entertainment tax, octroi and local tax were levied together by state and centre. These led to a lot of overlapping of taxes levied by both the state and the centre.', 'For example, when goods were manufactured and sold, excise duty was charged by the centre. Over and above the excise duty, VAT was also charged by the state. It led to a tax on tax effect, also known as the cascading effect of taxes.', 'The following is the list of indirect taxes in the pre-GST regime:', 'CGST, SGST, and IGST have replaced all the above taxes.', 'However, certain taxes such as the GST levied for the inter-state purchase at a concessional rate of 2% by the issue and utilisation of ‘Form C’ is still prevalent.', 'It applies to certain non-GST goods such as:', 'It applies to the following transactions only:', 'During the pre-GST regime, every purchaser, including the final consumer paid tax on tax. This condition of tax on tax is known as the cascading effect of taxes.', 'GST has removed the cascading effect. Tax is calculated only on the value-addition at each stage of the transfer of ownership. Understand what the cascading effect is and how GST helps by watching this simple video:', 'The indirect tax system under GST will integrate the country with a uniform tax rate. It will improve the collection of taxes as well as boost the development of the Indian economy by removing the indirect tax barriers between states.', 'Based on the above example of the biscuit manufacturer, let’s take some actual figures to see what happens to the cost of goods and the taxes, by comparing the earlier GST regimes.', 'Tax calculations in earlier regime:', 'The tax liability was passed on at every stage of the transaction, and the final liability comes to a rest with the customer. This condition is known as the cascading effect of taxes, and the value of the item keeps increasing every time this happens.', 'Tax calculations in current regime:', 'In the case of Goods and Services Tax, there is a way to claim the credit for tax paid in acquiring input. The individual who has already paid a tax can claim credit for this tax when he submits his GST returns.', 'In the end, every time an individual is able to claims the input tax credit, the sale price is reduced and the cost price for the buyer is reduced because of lower tax liability. The final value of the biscuits is therefore reduced from Rs.2,244 to Rs.1,980, thus reducing the tax burden on the final customer.', 'Apart from online filing of the GST returns, the GST regime has introduced several new systems along with it.', 'e-Way Bills', 'GST introduced a centralised system of waybills by the introduction of “E-way bills”. This system was launched on 1st April 2018 for inter-state movement of goods and on 15th April 2018 for intra-state movement of goods in a staggered manner.', 'Under the e-way bill system, manufacturers, traders and transporters can generate e-way bills for the goods transported from the place of its origin to its destination on a common portal with ease. Tax authorities are also benefited as this system has reduced time at check -posts and helps reduce tax evasion.', 'E-invoicing', 'The e-invoicing system was made applicable from 1st October 2020 for businesses with an annual aggregate turnover of more than Rs.500 crore in any preceding financial years (from 2017-18). Further, from 1st January 2021, this system was extended to those with an annual aggregate turnover of more than Rs.100 crore.', 'These businesses must obtain a unique invoice reference number for every business-to-business invoice by uploading on the GSTN’s invoice registration portal. The portal verifies the correctness and genuineness of the invoice. Thereafter, it authorises using the digital signature along with a QR code.', 'e-Invoicing allows interoperability of invoices and helps reduce data entry errors. It is designed to pass the invoice information directly from the IRP to the GST portal and the e-way bill portal. It will, therefore, eliminate the requirement for manual data entry while filing GSTR-1 and helps in the generation of e-way bills too.', 'For further reading and understanding, check out our articles:'], 'Multi-stage': ['An item goes through multiple change-of-hands along its supply chain: Starting from manufacture until the final sale to the consumer.', 'Let us consider the following stages:', '\xa0', 'The Goods and Services Tax is levied on each of these stages making it a multi-stage tax.', '', 'A manufacturer who makes biscuits buys flour, sugar and other material.

Though the ‘formula’ or a set of rules was agreed to by several Grand Prix organisations before World War II, races were suspended during the war.', 'Formula One, a new set of rules, were agreed upon by the racing organisations in 1946. The first non-championship race was the Turin Grand Prix held the same year in Italy. The following year the World Drivers’ Championship was formalised. Achille Varzi, an Italian driver, won the race in an Alfa Romeo.', 'The first world championship race was held in 1950 at Silverstone in the United Kingdom. Guiseppe Farina, an Italian driver in his Alfa Romeo, was the first driver to win the World Drivers’ Championship that year.', 'Juan Manuel Fangio, an Argentinian driver and Farina’s teammate, narrowly missed the championship title in 1950. But Fangio came back strongly to win 1951, ‘54, ‘55, ‘56 and ‘57 championship titles. His record of 5 championship titles was surpassed 45 years later when Michael Schumacher won his sixth World Driver’s Championship in 2003.', 'The Constructors Championship was introduced in 1958. Then called the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, the first cup in 1958 was won by Vanwall.', 'According to FIA, the Constructors Championship, “the constructor of an engine or chassis is the person (including any corporate or unincorporated body) which owns the intellectual rights to such engine or chassis.”', 'That is the reason teams have had names such as McLaren-Renault in the past. It meant that while the chassis of the F1 car was built by McLaren, the engine was supplied by Renault. Both parties worked together to build a car suited to the tracks and their drivers.', 'Over the years there have been only five countries that have shared the Constructors’ Championship between them. The countries are the UK leading with 33 championships, Italy (16), Germany (8), Austria (4) and France (3). Ferrari of Italy with 16 championships is the top constructor to date.', 'Formula One went through many changes in its rules. Most of the changes were aimed at minimising risk to the cars and drivers and increasing the spectator appeal of the sport. There were changes in engine sizes, car width and lengths, fuel tank sizes and the sizes of the tyres.', 'Formula One is all about cars and every fan would like to know more about them. They are indeed a fascinating piece of machinery and a lot of effort goes into their construction. That is precisely why the Constructor’s Championship is awarded at the end of every racing season.', 'Cars have evolved drastically over almost seventy years of Formula One. Today’s cars are much safer and more manoeuvrable. The aerodynamics have improved and electronics have crept in substantially over the years. Because of that, drivers have better control over the cars resulting in better speeds and fewer accidents. However, F1 cars still have open wheels and open cockpits and are single-seated.', 'The body of a Formula 1 car is made from lightweight materials like carbon fiber, which helps to keep the car as light as possible. The cars are also designed to be as aerodynamic as possible, with sleek, low-slung bodies and complex aerodynamic features like wings and diffusers.', 'Under the hood, Formula 1 cars are powered by highly advanced engines that can produce over 1,000 horsepower. These engines are hybrid V6 turbocharged units, and they are designed to be as efficient and powerful as possible.', 'One of the most distinctive features of a Formula 1 car is the open cockpit, which allows the driver to be fully exposed to the elements and gives them a clear view of the track ahead. The driver sits in a low-slung seat that is designed to be as comfortable and supportive as possible, and they are surrounded by a roll cage for safety.', 'Formula One cars are aerodynamically designed to provide the least resistance as they cut through the air. The feature not only helps them attain great speeds but also to consume less fuel as well as to get a better grip on the tarmac.', 'Because of their aerodynamic design Formula cars attain a speed greater than that of an airliner at take-off. But the wings and the diffusers of the car produce a negative lift or a downforce that presses the car down upon the track. Or else, drivers would have little control over the cars as cars would be airborne over the track because of the airlift.', 'A Formula One car produces 5G of downforce on average. It means that five times the weight of the car is pressing down on the track. This gives the tyres traction and prevents the car from skidding on bends and sharp corners. The downforce also allows the drivers to take corners and bends at speeds much higher than we could in our road cars.', 'Since 2014, all F1 cars have 1.6L, V6 turbocharged engines. To those uninitiated, the number after ‘V’ stands for the number of cylinders on the engine. The number before ‘L’ represents the displacement volume in litres of all the cylinders of the engine taken together.', 'F1 cars are required to weigh a minimum of 746kgs without the driver and fuel in them. Constructors, along with the other members of the team including drivers, have to optimise the horsepower, torque and fuel efficiency to suit their requirements. That is why F1 cars’ engines are fine-tuned for every F1 circuit.', 'Revolutions per minute or revs as we call it, for F1 car engines are limited to 15000 rpm. F1 cars are capable of speeds of up to 375 (235 mph) kilometres per hour. Juan Pablo Montoya hit a top speed of 372.6 kph (231.523 mph) during the Italian Grand Prix in 2005 while driving a McLaren-Mercedes car.', 'Tyres play a big part in Formula One races. Pirelli is officially recognised as the tyre supplier by FIA for Formula One. Unlike street car tyres, Formula One car tyres are built to last only between 60 to 120 kilometres (40 to 80 miles).', 'Because one set of tyres will not last the distance of any F1 race, drivers have to make pit stops to replace tyres so that they can complete the races. Formula One car tyres are rated from C1 to C5 with C1 the hardest tyres and C5 the softest.', 'Until the conclusion of the 2021 season F1 used 13-inch tyres, however, from 2022 they moved to 18-inch tyres as part of a raft of new technical regulations designed to make the racing more even. ', 'Participants in Formula One are not individuals but teams. You may not realise it, but each Formula One team employs hundreds of technicians, engineers and support staff. If you include the designers and the assembly employees, that number could well exceed one thousand.', 'There are ten teams enrolled for the 2023 Formula One season with two cars each. According to the rules for the season, a maximum of 26 cars will be allowed to compete. That would mean a maximum of 13 teams because each team is allowed to field two cars.', 'A formula One team comprises all the entities that design and produce the car and own the intellectual rights. Therefore if the chassis is designed by one company and the engine is supplied by another, the two taken together become the participating team. That is the reason you will hear names like Benetton-Ford or Williams-Renault.', 'Here is the list of F1 teams for 2023, along with their drivers:', 'As you can see from the above list, only one entity is listed as a team in each of the ten teams. It means that either the teams are constructing the cars by themselves or the engine and chassis builders have handed over the intellectual rights to the teams.', 'Formula One drivers are as fit as most athletes in any sport. They have very high stamina and extremely good reflexes. Driving a race is very demanding both physically and mentally. That is why drivers dedicate a lot of time both during the season and otherwise maintaining their physical health and well-being.', 'All F1 drivers lose weight at the end of a race. That is because a lot of energy is spent by the drivers in working the brake and throttle pedals and concentrating on the track.

There were changes in engine sizes, car width and lengths, fuel tank sizes and the sizes of the tyres.', 'Formula One is all about cars and every fan would like to know more about them. They are indeed a fascinating piece of machinery and a lot of effort goes into their construction. That is precisely why the Constructor’s Championship is awarded at the end of every racing season.', 'Cars have evolved drastically over almost seventy years of Formula One. Today’s cars are much safer and more manoeuvrable. The aerodynamics have improved and electronics have crept in substantially over the years. Because of that, drivers have better control over the cars resulting in better speeds and fewer accidents. However, F1 cars still have open wheels and open cockpits and are single-seated.', 'The body of a Formula 1 car is made from lightweight materials like carbon fiber, which helps to keep the car as light as possible.

The feature not only helps them attain great speeds but also to consume less fuel as well as to get a better grip on the tarmac.', 'Because of their aerodynamic design Formula cars attain a speed greater than that of an airliner at take-off. But the wings and the diffusers of the car produce a negative lift or a downforce that presses the car down upon the track. Or else, drivers would have little control over the cars as cars would be airborne over the track because of the airlift.', 'A Formula One car produces 5G of downforce on average. It means that five times the weight of the car is pressing down on the track. This gives the tyres traction and prevents the car from skidding on bends and sharp corners. The downforce also allows the drivers to take corners and bends at speeds much higher than we could in our road cars.', 'Since 2014, all F1 cars have 1.6L, V6 turbocharged engines.

The feature not only helps them attain great speeds but also to consume less fuel as well as to get a better grip on the tarmac.', 'Because of their aerodynamic design Formula cars attain a speed greater than that of an airliner at take-off. But the wings and the diffusers of the car produce a negative lift or a downforce that presses the car down upon the track. Or else, drivers would have little control over the cars as cars would be airborne over the track because of the airlift.', 'A Formula One car produces 5G of downforce on average. It means that five times the weight of the car is pressing down on the track. This gives the tyres traction and prevents the car from skidding on bends and sharp corners.

But before we explore the physiology of music’s effect on the brain, it’s important to understand how our bodies interact with sound as a whole.\xa0', 'Put simply, our body perceives sound as vibrations and translates those signals to electric pulses. While that might not seem particularly “simple” —\xa0in fact it is one of the more complex things our bodies do each day — scientists have unraveled the principle stages of how sound moves from the source to the brain.', 'Everyone is familiar with the concept of sound waves, but sound can also travel as a set of pulses; these are the two primary patterns that sounds take as they travel. When these pressure variations travel through a specific material (usually air), they push and compress the molecules in their path and take a very specific shape.', 'Those pulses spread as they travel, growing wider and taller with time. As this cone expands, the pressure weakens and the sound becomes diluted or less powerful, which affects how clearly we are able to hear them. But that original “shape” remains.', 'With this mental image, it’s easy to see how “sound” quickly becomes “noise.” Crowded streets are full of competing pulses, while a single sound travels differently through air as compared to another medium like water or rock.', 'Music is an even more complicated set of audio signals because it can consist of sounds from multiple sources, at multiple frequencies, and sometimes even from multiple directions. And the way sound travels becomes even more complex when we think about hearing range, sound diffusion, and how different sources create different sound wave shapes.\xa0', '“Hearing” truly begins when sound waves pass through the ear canal and reach the eardrum. Our bodies receive and process sound in three different stages: the signal of a specific sound travels into the outer ear (eardrum), is transcribed by the middle ear (ossicles), and is broadcast to the inner ear (cochlea) where it passes on to the brain.', 'Once sound waves reach the eardrum, a delicate set of organs and bones get to work. These pieces function similarly to a stopwatch or even a computer hard drive, with a dozen different minuscule components working in tandem over the course of a microsecond.\xa0', 'As each sound wave reaches the outer ear, it causes the eardrum to vibrate like a strummed rubber band. This movement shifts then three tiny bones — the smallest in the human body, in fact — which amplifies those vibrations as they pass on to the cochlea.', 'The cochlea, which has a shape similar to a nautilus shell, is lined with tiny hairs. And as the sound vibrations reach different sections of the cochlea, these hairs —\xa0called stereocilia —\xa0move up and town. That, in turn, opens up pores that release neurotransmitters into a nerve connecting the cochlea to the brain.', 'Finally, those chemicals travel along the auditory nerve and are received, processed, and recognized by the brain as specific sounds. All of that happens at near-instantaneous speeds every millisecond of every day, regardless of whether we are awake or asleep.', 'This video from the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communications Disorders animates the entire process from start to finish:', '\xa0', '\xa0', 'Sound signals affect many sections of the brain, but each area reacts differently based on how the brain categorizes the auditory signal. Music in particular takes full advantage of that process by generating a wide variety of mental, emotional, and physical reactions. And it is that variety that makes the psychology of music a focal point for many scientific studies.', 'Multiple sound sources often create “noise” that muddy our brain’s ability to single out and process specific sounds. That is especially true with sounds at varying decibels and wavelengths, similar to the illustration of a busy city street.', 'Music, however, is both a simple sound and a complex amalgamation of different sounds. Yet — when properly arranged — the human brain is able to receive that signal and then separate the individual instruments and vocals. It can also recognize specific music chords or notes, understand multiple sets of lyrics, and physically react to the beat, all at the same time.', 'Those levels of complexity add to the artfulness of music and how songs are composed and arranged to generate emotions and pleasure. But before we can explore the art of music and the different ways it can be used to improve our lives, we need to understand the many ways that music interacts with our brains.', 'Scientists have singled out a dozen different areas of the brain that respond to music, but five regions have the most significant impact on the listener. They are the:', 'We’ll look at each of these separately to see how sound (and specifically music) can affect the brain’s natural physiological purpose.', 'The temporal lobe serves a variety of roles, and one of them is language comprehension. This plays an important part in how we hear and react to the world around us, particularly in regards to conversation.', 'As our brain’s language center, the temporal lobe allows us to understand song lyrics. The temporal lobe is constantly engaged when we listen to music —\xa0even songs without lyrics.\xa0', 'The temporal lobe functions as the processing center for music, but two of its subregions allow us to further enjoy what we hear. Wernicke’s area is the part of the brain that analyzes and comprehends what we hear, turning the words of a song into specific phrases and stories.', 'Meanwhile, Broca’s area gives us the ability to form our words ourselves so we can sing along with the music or discuss what we are hearing.', 'While the amygdala is tucked within the temporal lobe, it serves a purpose that makes it stand apart. The amygdala is the emotional switchboard of the brain, managing both negative emotions (fear or displeasure) as well as positive emotions (enthusiasm or tranquility).', 'The amygdala ties into the “fight or flight” instinct of the brain; it is the part of the brain that processes sounds and determines our emotional reactions to them. So while the amygdala can alert someone to an approaching ambulance or an angry dog, it is also the part that makes us smile when we hear a familiar voice or the calming songs of rainfall.', 'The amygdala’s connection to music is an obvious one, and studies show that responses to certain music genres are almost universal. Music can trigger those same emotional cues as the sounds mentioned above: a horror film soundtrack elicits an almost primal fear, while a soaring battle march can create a surge of excitement.', 'Similarly, meditation music can soothe the mind and body to produce a calming effect. And a plucky pop song can force an easy smile, regardless of the listener’s previous mood. All of these physiological responses to music stem from the amygdala.', 'The frontal lobe, on the other hand, is where we do our thinking, planning, and reasoning. While neurologists have yet to fully understand how music affects the frontal lobe, we do know that our interests and opinions about music — and specifically our tastes in genres and songs —\xa0stem from frontal lobe activity.', 'Research shows that the frontal lobe functions as a hub for how we respond to certain music. Those specifics continue to be the focus of much study, but this area of the brain is a frequent focus for music therapists.\xa0', 'A normal byproduct to music is movement, and that is tied directly to the cerebellum. Whether that means tapping a foot, dancing a jig, or strumming an air guitar, the cerebellum is the part of the brain that triggers and coordinates movement in response to (or in time with) music.\xa0', 'Playing instruments also relies entirely on this part of the brain. Studies have shown that even a few weeks of piano lessons can alter the cerebellum. In fact, those functional changes aren’t restricted to playing music —\xa0listening to music or even imagining playing the piano can have the same effect.', 'The cerebellum also manages muscle memory. While a person’s cognitive abilities and long-term memory can fade over time, the cerebellum —\xa0as a separate part of the brain —\xa0ages differently. This has led to stories of coma victims reacting to music, Alzheimer’s patients playing instruments, and stroke victims finding their voice through song. As a result, the cerebellum is particularly valuable for many forms of music therapy.', 'Listening to music does not only have a transient effect on the brain; research shows that hearing or playing music alters both brain structure and brain function, particularly in situations where the same music is played frequently. This is because the hippocampus serves as a total contrast to the cerebellum.', 'As the brain’s memory center, the hippocampus is in charge of storing information. It also regulates emotional responses to certain things, which can be tied to memories associated with similar triggers.', 'Multiple scientific studies on the hippocampus have shown a strong tie between music listening, long-term memory, and short-term memory. The repetitive nature of music, with its motifs and phrases, activates short-term memory while simultaneously building long-term memories. That’s why people can remember a song they heard on the radio the previous day, but then 30 years later they also remember the outfit they wore and who else was in the car when they heard that song.', 'This effect can vary based upon the type of music being played. And that gives further credit to the idea that music can be a powerfully influential force on brain function. Music can be written to target different brain regions, which in turn elicit different reactions from the listener. While that allows musicians and composers to create truly moving pieces of music, it is proof that music can be a valuable tool for healthcare providers.', 'New studies continue to showcase music’s effects on the brain. As a result, music therapy has become an increasingly valuable tool for helping patients with all sorts of injuries and negative life experiences. While trauma of any sort can lead to different types of brain atrophy, we now know that music can have the opposite effect; it may not fully repair damaged brain tissue, but music therapy can help create new pathways to compensate for that loss.\xa0\xa0', 'A 2018 study proved that changes in brain function (caused by listening to music) activates specific areas of the brain, which can promote healing. And that healing can take a variety of forms, such as reduced depression, improved abstract thinking, heightened motivation, etc.', 'That study went on to suggest that music therapy could be used to deal with anything from “subjective distress experience in chronic pain syndromes, to the reward circuitry involved in addictive disorders, to the psychomotor pathways involved in Parkinson’s disease, and even to the functional connectivity changes that occur in autism spectrum disorders.”', 'That is not to say that music is some sort of mystical cure-all for every ailment. But there is evidence that implementation of music therapy can succeed as a means of giving people strength as they undergo surgery, chemotherapy, and other complicated treatment regimens.\xa0', 'These outcomes can provide encouraging results for many people, but future studies will be required to show the lasting effects of music therapy. Creating new pathways through the brain could circumvent damaged tissue, thereby restoring previously lost functions. So while music therapy may never provide a path to reverting neurological disorders, there are still obvious benefits from incorporating music into a patient’s therapeutic habits.', 'Music therapy dates back all the way to Ancient Greece — specifically the writings of Plato and Aristotle — and there are earlier records of music being used in ritualistic healings around the world. However, the first scientific papers on the topic began to appear in the late 1700s.', 'The earliest modern implementations of music therapy were immediately following World War II. Musicians would perform for hospitalized veterans as a means to raise their spirits and help them deal with psychological trauma that they carried home from those battlefields. But the benefits of these performances were so significant that doctors began to study the impact of music on mental health.', 'Over the next few decades, this research led many therapists to dedicate their whole careers to studying the psychology of music. Some of the music therapy pioneers were Isa Maud Ilsen (founder of the National Association of Music in Hospitals), Harriet Ayer Seymour (founder of the National Foundation of Music Therapy), E. Thayer Gaston (considered the “father of music therapy”), and Ira Altshuler, whose efforts led to the first collegiate music therapy training program.', 'All of those individual efforts culminated in the founding of the American Music Therapy Association in 1998. This association is an advocate for promoting music therapy across the government and academia, and it eventually grew to become the main hub for music therapy research, education, and resources throughout the United States and more than 30 other countries.', 'Music therapy can deliver a wide range of positive results, including but not limited to self-discovery, self-expression, and self-healing. But music can also bring a sense of community through performances both in-person and remote. Patients are able to practice this form of therapy long after they’ve completed their prescribed care regimen.', 'While music therapy is most effective when paired with other practices — like exercise, counseling, and social support — it can be used independently without sacrificing results. Popular implementations of music therapy include:', 'At the core of these practices is a singular fact: Music’s ability to alter brain function provides therapists with a valuable and repeatable tool. The ability to improve a patient’s mood and create a calm environment — regardless of the patient’s health — has helped integrate music therapy into most mental health providers. It also solidifies the importance of music in our culture.', 'Music can be used as a form of natural therapy for many different diseases, even showing benefits for those with severe physical or cognitive impairments regardless of age or mental health status. Recently, the University of Miami Health System implemented a music therapy program as part of their cancer treatment practice.', 'The goal of this is to use all sides of music —\xa0writing, listening, playing, and singing —\xa0to activate different parts of the brain in whatever way each patient prefers.', 'Because of that flexibility, patients have been able to find comfort and strength through music therapy even during COVID-induced quarantine. And as further study is done on the topic of the psychology of music, it is safe to assume that we will see new ways to implement music into therapy regimens. As a result, music therapy will only grow in importance.', 'The psychology of music really comes down to how the brain processes sound, how music affects different parts of the brain, and how music therapy can be implemented. But perhaps the most significant and universal outcome of music therapy is that, at its core, music brings joy.', 'Listening to music triggers the same pleasure centers as eating a favorite food, exercising, or even having sex. This is a core reason behind why music therapy has become such a widespread inclusion from many mental health practices. And that remains true even in spite of a global pandemic; in fact, mandated quarantine made music even more important.', 'For many people, listening to music provided a way to manage global increases in anxiety, loneliness, and depression. So whether it is a means of reducing the effects of epilepsy, relieving the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, or even learning a new language, music has the power to improve a person’s life. And understanding how that can be implemented into mental health routines makes it a topic worth studying, understanding, and practicing.'], 'A Quick Look At Sound Waves': ['Everyone is familiar with the concept of sound waves, but sound can also travel as a set of pulses; these are the two primary patterns that sounds take as they travel.

Our bodies receive and process sound in three different stages: the signal of a specific sound travels into the outer ear (eardrum), is transcribed by the middle ear (ossicles), and is broadcast to the inner ear (cochlea) where it passes on to the brain.', 'Once sound waves reach the eardrum, a delicate set of organs and bones get to work. These pieces function similarly to a stopwatch or even a computer hard drive, with a dozen different minuscule components working in tandem over the course of a microsecond.\xa0', 'As each sound wave reaches the outer ear, it causes the eardrum to vibrate like a strummed rubber band. This movement shifts then three tiny bones — the smallest in the human body, in fact — which amplifies those vibrations as they pass on to the cochlea.', 'The cochlea, which has a shape similar to a nautilus shell, is lined with tiny hairs. And as the sound vibrations reach different sections of the cochlea, these hairs —\xa0called stereocilia —\xa0move up and town. That, in turn, opens up pores that release neurotransmitters into a nerve connecting the cochlea to the brain.', 'Finally, those chemicals travel along the auditory nerve and are received, processed, and recognized by the brain as specific sounds. All of that happens at near-instantaneous speeds every millisecond of every day, regardless of whether we are awake or asleep.', 'This video from the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communications Disorders animates the entire process from start to finish:', '\xa0', '\xa0', 'Sound signals affect many sections of the brain, but each area reacts differently based on how the brain categorizes the auditory signal. Music in particular takes full advantage of that process by generating a wide variety of mental, emotional, and physical reactions. And it is that variety that makes the psychology of music a focal point for many scientific studies.', 'Multiple sound sources often create “noise” that muddy our brain’s ability to single out and process specific sounds. That is especially true with sounds at varying decibels and wavelengths, similar to the illustration of a busy city street.', 'Music, however, is both a simple sound and a complex amalgamation of different sounds. Yet — when properly arranged — the human brain is able to receive that signal and then separate the individual instruments and vocals. It can also recognize specific music chords or notes, understand multiple sets of lyrics, and physically react to the beat, all at the same time.', 'Those levels of complexity add to the artfulness of music and how songs are composed and arranged to generate emotions and pleasure. But before we can explore the art of music and the different ways it can be used to improve our lives, we need to understand the many ways that music interacts with our brains.', 'Scientists have singled out a dozen different areas of the brain that respond to music, but five regions have the most significant impact on the listener. They are the:', 'We’ll look at each of these separately to see how sound (and specifically music) can affect the brain’s natural physiological purpose.', 'The temporal lobe serves a variety of roles, and one of them is language comprehension. This plays an important part in how we hear and react to the world around us, particularly in regards to conversation.', 'As our brain’s language center, the temporal lobe allows us to understand song lyrics. The temporal lobe is constantly engaged when we listen to music —\xa0even songs without lyrics.\xa0', 'The temporal lobe functions as the processing center for music, but two of its subregions allow us to further enjoy what we hear. Wernicke’s area is the part of the brain that analyzes and comprehends what we hear, turning the words of a song into specific phrases and stories.', 'Meanwhile, Broca’s area gives us the ability to form our words ourselves so we can sing along with the music or discuss what we are hearing.', 'While the amygdala is tucked within the temporal lobe, it serves a purpose that makes it stand apart. The amygdala is the emotional switchboard of the brain, managing both negative emotions (fear or displeasure) as well as positive emotions (enthusiasm or tranquility).', 'The amygdala ties into the “fight or flight” instinct of the brain; it is the part of the brain that processes sounds and determines our emotional reactions to them. So while the amygdala can alert someone to an approaching ambulance or an angry dog, it is also the part that makes us smile when we hear a familiar voice or the calming songs of rainfall.', 'The amygdala’s connection to music is an obvious one, and studies show that responses to certain music genres are almost universal. Music can trigger those same emotional cues as the sounds mentioned above: a horror film soundtrack elicits an almost primal fear, while a soaring battle march can create a surge of excitement.', 'Similarly, meditation music can soothe the mind and body to produce a calming effect. And a plucky pop song can force an easy smile, regardless of the listener’s previous mood. All of these physiological responses to music stem from the amygdala.', 'The frontal lobe, on the other hand, is where we do our thinking, planning, and reasoning. While neurologists have yet to fully understand how music affects the frontal lobe, we do know that our interests and opinions about music — and specifically our tastes in genres and songs —\xa0stem from frontal lobe activity.', 'Research shows that the frontal lobe functions as a hub for how we respond to certain music. Those specifics continue to be the focus of much study, but this area of the brain is a frequent focus for music therapists.\xa0', 'A normal byproduct to music is movement, and that is tied directly to the cerebellum.

As a result, the cerebellum is particularly valuable for many forms of music therapy.', 'Listening to music does not only have a transient effect on the brain; research shows that hearing or playing music alters both brain structure and brain function, particularly in situations where the same music is played frequently. This is because the hippocampus serves as a total contrast to the cerebellum.', 'As the brain’s memory center, the hippocampus is in charge of storing information. It also regulates emotional responses to certain things, which can be tied to memories associated with similar triggers.', 'Multiple scientific studies on the hippocampus have shown a strong tie between music listening, long-term memory, and short-term memory. The repetitive nature of music, with its motifs and phrases, activates short-term memory while simultaneously building long-term memories.

The amygdala is the emotional switchboard of the brain, managing both negative emotions (fear or displeasure) as well as positive emotions (enthusiasm or tranquility).', 'The amygdala ties into the “fight or flight” instinct of the brain; it is the part of the brain that processes sounds and determines our emotional reactions to them. So while the amygdala can alert someone to an approaching ambulance or an angry dog, it is also the part that makes us smile when we hear a familiar voice or the calming songs of rainfall.', 'The amygdala’s connection to music is an obvious one, and studies show that responses to certain music genres are almost universal. Music can trigger those same emotional cues as the sounds mentioned above: a horror film soundtrack elicits an almost primal fear, while a soaring battle march can create a surge of excitement.', 'Similarly, meditation music can soothe the mind and body to produce a calming effect. And a plucky pop song can force an easy smile, regardless of the listener’s previous mood. All of these physiological responses to music stem from the amygdala.', 'The frontal lobe, on the other hand, is where we do our thinking, planning, and reasoning. While neurologists have yet to fully understand how music affects the frontal lobe, we do know that our interests and opinions about music — and specifically our tastes in genres and songs —\xa0stem from frontal lobe activity.', 'Research shows that the frontal lobe functions as a hub for how we respond to certain music. Those specifics continue to be the focus of much study, but this area of the brain is a frequent focus for music therapists.\xa0', 'A normal byproduct to music is movement, and that is tied directly to the cerebellum. Whether that means tapping a foot, dancing a jig, or strumming an air guitar, the cerebellum is the part of the brain that triggers and coordinates movement in response to (or in time with) music.\xa0', 'Playing instruments also relies entirely on this part of the brain. Studies have shown that even a few weeks of piano lessons can alter the cerebellum. In fact, those functional changes aren’t restricted to playing music —\xa0listening to music or even imagining playing the piano can have the same effect.', 'The cerebellum also manages muscle memory. While a person’s cognitive abilities and long-term memory can fade over time, the cerebellum —\xa0as a separate part of the brain —\xa0ages differently. This has led to stories of coma victims reacting to music, Alzheimer’s patients playing instruments, and stroke victims finding their voice through song. As a result, the cerebellum is particularly valuable for many forms of music therapy.', 'Listening to music does not only have a transient effect on the brain; research shows that hearing or playing music alters both brain structure and brain function, particularly in situations where the same music is played frequently. This is because the hippocampus serves as a total contrast to the cerebellum.', 'As the brain’s memory center, the hippocampus is in charge of storing information. It also regulates emotional responses to certain things, which can be tied to memories associated with similar triggers.', 'Multiple scientific studies on the hippocampus have shown a strong tie between music listening, long-term memory, and short-term memory. The repetitive nature of music, with its motifs and phrases, activates short-term memory while simultaneously building long-term memories. That’s why people can remember a song they heard on the radio the previous day, but then 30 years later they also remember the outfit they wore and who else was in the car when they heard that song.', 'This effect can vary based upon the type of music being played. And that gives further credit to the idea that music can be a powerfully influential force on brain function. Music can be written to target different brain regions, which in turn elicit different reactions from the listener. While that allows musicians and composers to create truly moving pieces of music, it is proof that music can be a valuable tool for healthcare providers.', 'New studies continue to showcase music’s effects on the brain. As a result, music therapy has become an increasingly valuable tool for helping patients with all sorts of injuries and negative life experiences. While trauma of any sort can lead to different types of brain atrophy, we now know that music can have the opposite effect; it may not fully repair damaged brain tissue, but music therapy can help create new pathways to compensate for that loss.\xa0\xa0', 'A 2018 study proved that changes in brain function (caused by listening to music) activates specific areas of the brain, which can promote healing. And that healing can take a variety of forms, such as reduced depression, improved abstract thinking, heightened motivation, etc.', 'That study went on to suggest that music therapy could be used to deal with anything from “subjective distress experience in chronic pain syndromes, to the reward circuitry involved in addictive disorders, to the psychomotor pathways involved in Parkinson’s disease, and even to the functional connectivity changes that occur in autism spectrum disorders.”', 'That is not to say that music is some sort of mystical cure-all for every ailment.

Creating new pathways through the brain could circumvent damaged tissue, thereby restoring previously lost functions. So while music therapy may never provide a path to reverting neurological disorders, there are still obvious benefits from incorporating music into a patient’s therapeutic habits.', 'Music therapy dates back all the way to Ancient Greece — specifically the writings of Plato and Aristotle — and there are earlier records of music being used in ritualistic healings around the world. However, the first scientific papers on the topic began to appear in the late 1700s.', 'The earliest modern implementations of music therapy were immediately following World War II. Musicians would perform for hospitalized veterans as a means to raise their spirits and help them deal with psychological trauma that they carried home from those battlefields.

That noise is the long, piercing scrape of metal against rock. It’s the sound, quite simply, of everything going wrong.', 'Edward Howe Watson heard that noise on September 8, 1923, at 9:05 p.m., while sitting in his ship’s quarters, directly beneath the bridge of the United States Navy destroyer Delphy. Watson was a 49-year-old naval commander—a\xa0privileged and pedigreed, blue-blooded son of an admiral, Kentucky born and Annapolis trained. A year earlier, he’d taken command of the Delphy’s entire squadron of 19 destroyers. This had been a promotion, a welcome sign of forward momentum in a long and varied Navy career. Privately, Watson told his wife that he’d have preferred a battleship. But he seemed just one promotion away from getting that too, and after that perhaps an admiralty, like his father before him.', '', 'The Delphy had left San Francisco that morning and spent the day speeding south along the coast of California. Thirteen more ships in Watson’s squadron trailed behind. The destination was their home port in San Diego. This was a training exercise—a speed trial, the sort of thing the Navy, under considerable budget pressures, hadn’t tried since the war. All day the destroyers maintained top speeds in challenging conditions: bad weather, massive waves, a civilian vessel requiring rescue. By late afternoon, no one on any of the ships could make out the coastline through the haze. Watson wasn’t concerned; he had one of the Navy’s best navigators for the Delphy’s skipper, and he was using dead reckoning—the time-tested technique of calculating location from a ship’s compass direction, estimated speed, and the amount of time traveled—to ensure that they were where they needed to be. Best of all, a rival squadron of destroyers, part of the same training exercise, were making worse time. Watson was winning the race.', 'By nightfall, the Delphy was coming close to the Santa Barbara Channel, with San Diego in reach by dawn. A few minutes before 9 p.m., Watson ordered a turn east toward the coast for the final approach into the channel. The entrance was a risky place for a squadron traveling at 20 knots—littered with rocks, reefs, and shipwrecks just beneath the water’s surface—but it was the shortest route, and using it all but guaranteed that Watson would win. The other ships would follow, and they’d all be home in record time.', 'That was when Watson heard the noise—first the scrape, and then a thunderous boom. In that flash of a moment, Watson knew. They were running aground. Careers would be destroyed, reputations and legacies wiped away—and, worst of all, lives could be lost. But he could not have known that what happened next would become the greatest peacetime disaster in the history of the U.S. Navy. That it would prompt a court-martial of 11 officers, also the largest of its kind in history. And that, in the aftermath, he would be forced to rethink everything he believed about the price of honor and the true meaning of leadership.', 'And that, even now, 100 years later, there would be no end to the arguments over who exactly was to blame.', 'The destroyers under Watson’s command were known as four-stackers, marked by a quartet of tall, identical cylinders arrayed neatly in a line down the ship’s center, like the bristles of a toothbrush. Each ship was 314 feet long and 32 feet wide, nimble and powerful enough to target German submarines during the First World War. But by the time Watson took command of Squadron 11 in 1922, the war was over, fuel was being rationed, and military funding had been slashed across the board. While four-stackers could carry as many as 131 men, budget cuts reduced the number on board to roughly 100. It was an unfortunate time to be rising in the Navy. America may have just won a war, but the nation’s reputation was fragile. Washington was a hotbed of corruption; President Warren Harding’s Teapot Dome bribery scandal had implicated naval secretary Edwin Denby. Now more than ever, the Navy needed a demonstration of confidence, of authority. And Watson needed the Navy, too, in his own way.', 'Watson had grown up amid privilege, his only care, perhaps, the burden of expectation. He was the eldest son of a powerful Kentucky family, a member of America’s brand of aristocracy. One of his great-grandfathers had served as governor, was a five-term U.S. senator, and advised two presidents. The family superstar was his father, John Crittenden Watson, who earned his place in history as a Union Navy lieutenant during the Civil War battle of Mobile Bay. In 1864, Captain James Farragut of the battleship Hartford led a squadron of ships into Confederate waters and shocked everyone around him when he ordered his fleet into a mine-strewn waterway, crying out, “Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!” Watson’s father was Farragut’s faithful aide-de-camp. He’d heard the captain say it, and quoted him for years afterward, codifying the legend.', 'Watson grew up with that story, which was also becoming the Navy’s story—the daring squadron commander defying all odds, cheating death, seizing his place in the world. He entered the Navy in his father’s shadow: The elder Watson went on to be an admiral, and often told the tale of how he’d been the one to lash Farragut to the Hartford’s rigging, so his body would be found if the ship went down. Between the younger Watson’s many postings—on the Amphitrite, the Maine, the Brooklyn, the Baltimore, the Richmond, the Prairie, the West Virginia, the Detroit, the Iris—his father would step in and offer plum assignments; Watson even went along as his father’s aide to the coronation of King Edward in London. He married well—a St. Louis socialite named Hermine Gratz, whose sister married a Rockefeller—and a life of ease awaited once his time in the Navy ended. But during the Great War, Watson only managed to take command of a battleship late in the effort, and he never saw combat. So when the destroyers of his squadron were given a chance to prove their worth, the opportunity couldn’t have come soon enough.', 'On Friday, September 7, 1923, Watson summoned Squadron 11’s commanders to a meeting. The ships were docked in San Francisco, where the crews were on shore leave. Watson announced that he’d lead them to their home port in San Diego on a training exercise, coupled with gunnery and tactical drills. Their orders, Watson said, were to travel at 20 knots, faster than any ship had been permitted in years.', 'For the first time since the war, these destroyers would do what they’d been built to do, although it would come with some risk. There was no telling what toll such an extreme pace would take on the ships’ turbines when sustained for 453 nautical miles. Watson shrugged off such concerns; that was what the exercise was for. Besides, Squadron 11 wouldn’t be the only fleet of destroyers bound for San Diego that day. Squadron 12 was going, too. This would be a race, and Watson intended to win it.', 'William L. Calhoun was ten years younger than Watson, in his late thirties, and a touch portly, with thinning blond hair. Like Watson, he had something of a pedigree: His great-grandfather was John C. Calhoun, the South Carolina senator who served as vice president under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. But unlike Watson, no one seemed to expect great things from Calhoun. He grew up in Palatka, Florida, and went to public school before scoring a spot at the Naval Academy. Calhoun once said that on his way out of town, a schoolteacher told him he wouldn’t amount to anything.', 'Calhoun proved that teacher wrong, working his way up from ensign to gunnery officer to chief engineer before switching to submarines, commanding a division of them during the war. He came home highly decorated in 1918, but endured several more humdrum postings before, in 1923, he was given command of a ship—a destroyer in Watson’s Squadron 11.', 'If the new job intimidated Calhoun, he didn’t show it. Aboard the ship, the young commander was something of a breath of fresh air, at least compared with his predecessor, whom many had found brusque. As a leader, Calhoun cultivated a mix of relentlessly demanding and personally appealing. The crew liked him straight away. They wanted to impress him.', 'Then, in September, came the orders from Watson. After paying his dues and biding his time, Calhoun was facing his first trial as the skipper of his own ship.', 'Eugene Dooman was in the lobby of the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco when he spotted his old friend Edward Watson. It was September 7, the same day Watson had given his squadron their orders. Dooman was a 32-year-old career diplomat who’d been stationed at the American embassy in Tokyo for a decade. He’d met Watson during the three years the captain lived there after the war, serving as a naval attaché. Watson and Dooman shared a love of Japanese culture and a fascination with the country’s history and the traditions of its royal family. Now Dooman was at the start of a long leave back in America and glad for this chance meeting, because he was in a jam.', 'Dooman had brought something bulky and valuable with him from Japan—a heavy leather valise containing $3,000 in silver coins. This, oddly enough, would be his travel budget during his time away from Japan. Instead of paper money or a letter of credit, his bank in Tokyo persuaded him to accept silver; the bank would need to back up any large withdrawal with silver anyway, and if Dooman took it to America with him he’d save the bank freight and insurance. For his trouble, the bank gave him an extra $400.', 'Dooman hadn’t counted on the bank being closed when he reached San Francisco. Worse yet, it was a Friday. Dooman would be stuck with a burdensome valise filled with silver until Monday, and he was scheduled to leave on Saturday for his next stop, Los Angeles. But now, in the hotel lobby with Watson, a solution presented itself.', 'Watson told Dooman that he was taking his squadron to San Diego early the next morning, and he invited him along. It would require a little domestic diplomacy on Watson’s part: His wife, Hermine, had asked him to bring their nine-year-old daughter, Clifford, on the Delphy, while she accompanied some friends on a road trip to San Diego. But Watson never warmed to the thought of having along a young girl on a destroyer. With just one available cabin on the ship, Dooman was a convenient excuse for Watson to change the plan.', 'The diplomat said yes right away. The invitation neatly solved his problem. It would be easy enough to get a train to Los Angeles from the squadron’s destination of San Diego, and Dooman’s silver would be well protected during the journey. Watson cleared his guest through official channels, and Dooman arranged for a trunk with the rest of his belongings to be sent ahead to his hotel in Los Angeles.', 'The next morning at 7 a.m., Dooman, valise in hand, arrived at the San Francisco Navy pier. The diplomat was ushered aboard the Delphy and into the guest cabin, where he changed into a heavy tweed suit to block the wind while on deck. He intended to enjoy the trip.', 'For Watson, it was no small thing to run into a friend from Tokyo. Japan was Watson’s last posting before taking command of Squadron 11. His time there may have been the most successful of his career. Decades later, a colleague called Watson “one of the most likable and dynamic, intelligent and alert naval attachés we have had in any country.”', 'Watson arrived in Tokyo in 1919 with orders to monitor the country’s designs on expansion. Japan had been making strides toward imperialism, and Washington was determined to maintain U.S. influence around the world after the war. Watson’s predecessor left him with very little in the way of intel, forcing him to start with next to nothing. But after hosting parties for his Japanese counterparts, Watson discovered that he had a knack for eliciting information. His technique, as later described by an underling, was “telling them too much so that they could learn too little.” Japanese officers found Watson’s chattiness mystifying, and disarming. He produced memos full of policy insights—many of which proved especially useful leading up to an international disarmament conference Japanese officials attended in Washington in late 1921. And he exposed attempts by the Japanese to bribe Navy officers for information.', 'Watson was making a name for himself for the first time, excelling at a game his father, the illustrious Civil War hero, had never played—a modern, 20th-century pastime, built for an age of global politics. Beyond his canny way with people, Watson also had a knack for seeing around corners. He insisted that the U.S. counter Japan’s efforts to control the Pacific, and when Washington failed to follow some of his recommendations, he issued a dire prophecy. “If we know the minute details of Japanese plans for aggression,” Watson said in 1922, “we are in a position to thwart them while they are still in the planning stage… Otherwise we shall one day be confronted with a surprise that will hit us right between the eyes.”', 'Watson seemed well positioned for the life of a diplomat, proto-spy, and statesman. All that ended abruptly when he received a promotion to command a squadron of destroyers. His career lurched back onto a familiar track—his father’s trajectory, the family business. Not without some regret, he returned home. Watson was coming up on 50 years old. This was a chance, maybe his last, to prove himself at sea.', 'Now Watson’s two paths were converging, or at least bumping up against each other for a day. At the very moment he was called upon to show his stuff as a naval commander, he also had the chance to catch up with a trusted colleague from his time in the Far East. The timing was even more welcome given how, just a week earlier, Japan had experienced a once-in-a-lifetime catastrophe. The great Kanto earthquake—even today the most lethal natural disaster by far in the nation’s history—had laid waste to much of Yokohama and Tokyo, followed by typhoon-fueled fires and powerful tsunamis. More than 100,000 deaths were estimated, and Tokyo was under martial law. Many around the world, Watson included, were anxious to hear what had been destroyed, how many lives lost. On the water, he and Dooman would have time to talk about it all.', '2.', 'Patches of sun broke through the San Francisco fog on the morning of Saturday, September 8, as Watson’s ships set off down the coast. Fourteen of the squadron’s destroyers would take part in the exercise, divided into three divisions, with Watson aboard the Delphy in front. The Delphy would handle navigation for all the ships. The others would follow the leader, just like many great Navy squadrons before them, including Farragut’s in Mobile Bay.', 'They hit a wall of haze at 8 a.m., but the gunnery exercises took place as scheduled. At 11:30 a.m., the crew of the Delphy spotted a lighthouse at Pigeon Point, one of several shore locations ships used for a visual fix. All seemed well. But this would be the last time that day anyone would be able to see land.', 'The weather was changing—first fog, then more haze. For the rest of the afternoon, the Delphy’s crew used dead reckoning to estimate its position. Lieutenant Commander Donald T. Hunter, the Delphy’s skipper, had taught navigation for two years at the Naval Academy. The California shoreline did not present much of a challenge. Based on the ship’s estimated speed of 20 knots and the typical currents, Hunter, working alongside the ship’s navigator, Lieutenant Laurence Blodgett, calculated their location and continued hurtling down the coast.', 'But a few hours passed and still no visibility. The Delphy had one more tool to assist with navigation: a radio device that allowed ships to request compass bearings from shore stations. Radio direction finding, or RDF, was still in its infancy—it would be the precursor to radar, which wouldn’t come to ships for more than a decade—but the technology had been a great help during the war, detecting the location of German submarines when they surfaced to send wireless transmissions. After the war, RDF had been slow to catch on. While a number of lighthouses up and down the East and West Coast were equipped with it, ships like the Delphy had only a clunky-looking circular antenna on board. Upon request, a\xa0lighthouse worker would use an RDF device to send a signal to the ship’s antenna, then contact the ship by traditional radio to\xa0provide a compass reading.  If a lighthouse was, say, due east from a ship, a navigator could use that reading to calculate the ship’s position. The system was far from ideal. There was, in fact, no way to tell which side of the looped antenna the station had detected, which meant that every reading came with an opposite possible “reciprocal” bearing. A bearing of due east sometimes really meant due west; it was up to the navigator to discern which was most likely correct.', 'To many seasoned Navy officers, RDF seemed almost foolish. What navigator worth his salt would trust dubious readings from a lighthouse jockey and a loop of wire over his own calculations? Hunter, who’d once famously made his way into an Alaskan port through a blinding fog, usually had little use for RDF. But three hours was a long time to go without seeing anything, so at 2:15 p.m. Hunter had his crew contact the only RDF-equipped station along the route—the lighthouse at Point Arguello, at the edge of the rugged coast that jutted out 80 miles northwest of Santa Barbara.', 'A radioman at the lighthouse sent back a compass reading: 167 degrees. This suggested that the ship had already passed Point Arguello, which was obviously wrong; they hadn’t been on the water nearly long enough. Hunter asked for a repeat bearing and got a similar reading. Meanwhile, the crew still weren’t able to see anything on the shore to confirm their position. When Blodgett, Hunter’s second-in-command, suggested moving closer to the coast to improve visibility, Hunter said no—that would force them to slow down and scuttle the squadron’s speed exercise. Instead, Hunter questioned the lighthouse radioman, radioing back that they were north of Point Arguello. The radioman supplied the reciprocal reading. That seemed to produce reasonable verification that they were where they thought they were.', 'For consequential calls like this one, Hunter turned to Watson, his commander, for approval. For much of the day, Watson had stayed off the bridge; by at least one account, he’d spent that time in his quarters, in conversation with Dooman, stepping out every hour or so to sign off on Hunter’s decisions. Watson agreed with his captain that they were where dead reckoning placed them—that the RDF had to be wrong. They continued on, the Delphy in front, 13 destroyers following. But their location on the route was hardly a trivial concern. Point Arguello marked the spot where Watson’s ships needed to turn left into the Santa Barbara Channel. If they turned too soon, they risked running headlong into Honda Point.', 'Everyone on the ships knew about Honda Point—a hook of land jutting out from the coast a few miles north of the entrance of the Santa Barbara Channel. The shore along Honda Point is made up of sharp igneous rock and steep bluffs with few beaches. The waves are relentless, and boulders and reefs lurk below the waterline like booby traps. Its original name, Point Pedernales, was from the Spanish como un pedernal, or “like flint.” Some referred to it as the Devil’s Jaw.', 'Then, as if to demonstrate the hazards ahead of them, news came of a crisis in the channel. Another vessel—not a Navy ship, but a steamer called the Cuba—had run aground that morning in the fog along the rocky shore of San Miguel Island, at the channel’s southern boundary. The Cuba had been full of passengers; a hundred people were floating in lifeboats or had already made it to shore. One of Watson’s division commanders, Walter G. Roper, aboard the destroyer Kennedy, asked to join the relief efforts.', 'Watson refused. The squadron had its orders, and another ship had already been sent to the Cuba’s aid. Watson thought it best to stay out of the way of the rescue operation, along with the rocks where the Cuba ran aground. He and Roper argued about it over the squadron’s party line—which meant that other crew members on Roper’s ship heard the exchange—and finally Roper relented.', 'For generations, the Navy had allowed its commanders extraordinary leeway in decision-making. It was standard procedure not to second-guess the man in charge. This was the ethos Watson grew up with, his father’s credo. He believed that his squadron needed him to lead, especially as the weather got worse—fog, rain, buckling waves, and the coast nowhere in sight. ', 'One of Watson’s ships, the John Francis Burnes, had dropped out of the exercise with a boiler problem. That was unfortunate, but for Hunter and Watson it was no reason for the rest of the squadron to slow down. At 4:27 p.m., with the fog even thicker, Watson ordered the remaining destroyers to assume a column formation, each boat following the one in front by sight, with just a few dozen yards between them. ', 'At 5 p.m. the sun came out briefly, but Hunter still couldn’t make out the horizon through the haze. Watson’s column of ships continued on for three more hours, unable to tell exactly where they were, yet confident they were far enough south of Honda Point.', 'At 8:35 p.m., the Delphy received another compass reading from the Point Arguello lighthouse. This time it placed them well north of the channel entrance. Watson, summoned to the bridge after dining with Dooman, couldn’t believe it. How could they have traveled all day and still be so far from the channel?', 'The more Watson thought it over, the less he trusted RDF. They were again faced with a choice: trust the new technology, or trust dead reckoning. And once again, they had a solution available to them that made sense of the confusing information they’d received: the reciprocal compass reading. When they flipped the RDF compass point, yet again the Delphy was where dead reckoning placed it. Problem solved, it seemed.', 'The Delphy’s navigator, Blodgett, knew that there was another tool they could use to make sure the ship had reached the channel: a fathometer, which measures depth. A shallow reading would mean the Delphy was too close to the coast to safely turn. Blodgett wanted to do a depth sounding. Hunter said it wasn’t necessary. And of course, to do a sounding they’d have to slow down.', 'Watson affirmed Hunter’s conclusion. He agreed that they had passed Point Arguello. This meant that the clock was ticking: To wait any longer would risk the ship hitting the far side of the channel, repeating the Cuba’s mistake. And so at 8:45 p.m., the Delphy laid plans for a 55-degree course change to port—a left turn, straight into the channel. Watson returned to his quarters.', 'From the bridge, Hunter could see the lights of ten or more ships behind him in the dark. Maybe visibility wasn’t so bad after all? But then, just after the turn, the\xa0Delphy plunged once again into a thick fog bank. The men on board couldn’t see a thing.', 'Two boats behind the Delphy on the Young, William Calhoun still couldn’t make out the lights from Point Arguello. Perhaps the fog was too thick, or the Young too far from shore? But he did see the lights of the Delphy and the S.P. Lee, just ahead, and some of the other ships behind. So he continued to follow the leader.', 'Then came a jolt to the ship—not so much heard as felt, a slight trembling in the hull. At once, Calhoun thought they’d been rammed, but by what? He rushed to the bridge just in time for a second jolt. There was nothing slight about this one. The Young’s navigator had lurched out of the formation—technically the correct reaction for a ship running aground—only to slam into something harder.', 'Right away the Young started to list, its engine room filling with water through a gash in the hull. It took just seconds for the entire destroyer to lean about 30 degrees. Then the power went out. Between the darkness and the fog, no one could see a thing. By the time Calhoun ordered his executive officer, Lieutenant Eugene Herzinger, to pass the word to stand by to abandon ship, the ship was listing nearly 45 degrees. This meant that the lifeboats were no longer an option—they were completely submerged.', 'Calhoun was left with one narrow hope: that the Young could somehow settle against whatever it was they’d rammed into and avoid sinking entirely.', 'He crawled up to the ship’s port side, which had now risen out of the water. The hull was coated in oil, and so slick that the crew that made it up there before him now had nothing to hang on to. Some had fallen into the water, and there seemed to be no way of helping them. To follow them in would doom them all.', 'And so Calhoun retracted his own order to stand by to abandon ship and told everyone around him to spread the word to gather on the port side, and above all not to jump into the water. “Don’t leave her—she is on the rocks!” Calhoun cried. “She can’t sink. Stick and you’ll be saved!”', 'On the Delphy, Dooman was with Watson in the captain’s quarters when a noise came from beneath the ship. That scrape of metal against rock was unmistakable. Even he, a civilian, knew that they had hit bottom.', 'Then came the crash. The ship lurched, sending both Dooman and Watson toppling and shattering the glass of the portholes. Dooman was thrown against the window at his back. Drawers jumped out of cabinets, papers flew, everything not nailed down was suddenly somewhere else. Without a word Watson dashed to the bridge, leaving Dooman alone.', 'The bridge was in chaos. As far as Watson and Hunter were concerned, there was only one possibility: They’d gone too far ahead, hitting the same spot that claimed the Cuba, San Miguel Island. They’d soon learn how wrong they were. But in that moment, Watson ordered two radio messages to the other ships: “keep clear to the westward” and “nine turn”—turn to port, where he thought the others could still get to the channel.', 'The collision with the rocks had sent the bow of the Delphy high into the air. Waves swung the ship around so that it was now astride the beach, braced against a series of rock outcroppings. Each new surge sent the vessel into spasms, quickly rupturing the hull. Down-the-line ships had followed the Delphy’s lead. The S.P. Lee swung around to the side of the shore and halted. The Young was next, lurching sideways and sinking; it smashed into the shore just moments before the Delphy and was almost gone. Watson could only guess what was in store for the other ships—maybe the rocky shore would claim them all.', 'There was a more immediate concern, however. The waves  slamming the Delphy repeatedly into the rocks had caused the fuel tanks to rupture. Hunter knew that the oil burners were still operational, making a boiler explosion all but imminent. He shut the master fuel valve from the bridge and ordered all crew in the engine room and the steaming fire rooms to lift the safety valves before coming up. By then the ship was pounding the rocks so violently that Hunter knew it was only a matter of time before it broke up and sank.', 'That was when Hunter asked Watson for permission to give the abandon ship order. Watson was quick to agree. But abandon for what? Oil from the Delphy was gushing into the surrounding water. The sea was a thick stew, with a five-inch slick on the surface, making swimming near impossible.', 'Back in Watson’s quarters, Dooman could hear the ship’s siren. He ran out on deck in time to see the Delphy’s searchlight beaming the water. He saw another ship crash, then another. He heard sirens and saw searchlights from those, too—ship after ship—and knew there had to be more behind them.', 'With men rushing everywhere and sirens wailing, a thought gripped Dooman: the silver. He stopped an officer, who told him that the lower part of the Delphy had flooded; this included the guest cabin where Dooman was staying. In any case, the silver was too heavy to carry if he needed to swim to safety. Dooman hurried back to Watson’s cabin. He sat down and waited, unsure of what to do next, or if he’d been forgotten completely.', 'The men on the top deck with Hunter were desperate to get off the ship. Some of the crew had braved the sludgy water and made it to an outcropping about 15 feet from shore; others became mired in the water, only to be pulled back onto the Delphy. Blodgett worked to set up a rope the men could use as a guide to the outcropping. Not everyone made it: Fireman Third Class James W. H. Conway and Cabin Cook Sofronio Dalida both died in the water.', 'Worst of all was the slow-motion tragedy of Fireman J. T. Pearson, who leapt overboard to help save three men in the water, shattered his glasses, and was blinded by the shards. Pearson cried for help and was pulled back aboard the Delphy. He was hysterical with pain and panic, and had taken in so much seawater and fuel that he fell to the deck. Blodgett held a flashlight as a pharmacist’s mate worked to remove the glass from Pearson’s eyes, to no avail. The ship was slick with oil, and equipment was flying everywhere, making it impossible to get Pearson onto a raft without endangering more lives.', 'Left with no other choice, Blodgett ordered a radioman to lash Pearson to the Delphy’s searchlight tower—what appeared to be a safe place amidships, forward of where the waves were breaking over the hull. They used a signal line that was tight enough to secure him, but not so tight that he couldn’t free himself if he regained his faculties.', 'The plan was to come back and evacuate him; that never happened. The waves raged into the night as, from the shore, the men of the Delphy could hear his repeated screams.', 'Calhoun didn’t know how long he had before the Young  would sink. The ship had tilted fully onto its side in practically no time at all; Calhoun later put it at just 90 seconds from the moment they ran aground. Now his ship was sliced open on the starboard side, with just two feet of the port side still above the surface of the water.', 'With the port side now the Young’s deck, some 80 men gripped the smashed portholes of the ship’s hull. Many were barefoot and wore what they’d gone to sleep in; some were tied to one another with lines. They waited for rescue as the waves crashed against the ship.', 'Calhoun knew that he hadn’t time for his men to put on life preservers and file into lifeboats: Like Hunter on the Delphy, he was aware that the active burners could explode the boiler, igniting the oil in the water around them. He asked for a volunteer to extinguish the burners. Fireman I.T. Scott came forward, then rushed below.', 'Minutes passed and Scott didn’t return. Had he cut the boiler? Did he escape the ship? Calhoun had no way to know for sure.', 'Calhoun’s executive officer, Gene Herzinger, and Chief Boatswain’s Mate Arthur Peterson climbed up and out from a bridge window. Peterson found an axe and smashed the portholes, providing the crew with handholds as the sea inundated the deck. They were 100 yards from shore, too far to risk swimming amid the oily waves and jagged rocks.', 'Or was it? Peterson wanted to try. He grabbed a life preserver and some rope and volunteered to swim for a large rock nearby. If he could reach that spot with the line, the other men could use it to get there, too, and they’d be that much closer to shore.', 'They were working through a plan when the Chauncey came into view. Calhoun nearly panicked. All it would take was one strong wake to shove the Young off its perch on the rock. The Chauncey got close enough to hear the Young’s crew—Calhoun loudest of them all—shouting not to collide with their sinking ship.', 'The Delphy’s lights went out. Alone in Watson’s quarters, Dooman couldn’t see a thing. He’d have no choice but to abandon the valise. Dooman returned to the deck, frightened but also appalled to have been forgotten.', 'The ship was low in the sea, and water swamped the deck. Dooman saw some of the crew at the stern, which appeared to be angled higher than the rest of the ship. Higher seemed safer, so he made his way in that direction, pulling himself along by the torpedo rails as waves smashed the deck. When Dooman arrived at the back of the Delphy, he saw that the men had run a line between the ship and a large rock 40 feet from shore. He also saw how dangerous it was—some who’d attempted the crossing had been flung into the water—and he was afraid to risk his life.', 'Dooman decided to run back to the front of the ship, until an officer shined a flashlight in his face. “You’re the passenger,” the officer said. It seemed that Dooman hadn’t been forgotten after all. He asked the man for help, and with the help of another sailor they found a raft stored on deck. They threw it over the side and jumped in, only to realize that it remained lashed to the Delphy. They were stuck. The ship slammed into the tiny craft, threatening to crash on top of them.', 'Dooman had a small penknife attached to his watch chain. He handed it to the sailor, who hacked through the line. With some effort, the raft made it over the waves to the rock. From there they were able to walk to land when the tide receded. One by one, Dooman and the others reached safety.', 'Watson finally made it across the line at 11 p.m. With one exception—Lieutenant Pearson, blinded and lashed to the rigging of a capsized, disintegrating vessel—the captain was the last to leave his ship.', 'The Chauncey threw all its power into reverse, but it was stuck with competing mandates—to avoid a collision with the Young, and to avoid the cliffs of Honda Point. In the end it hit the Young: The undertow hurled the Chauncey’s stern up against the destroyer’s port propeller blades, which ripped into the Chauncey’s starboard hull.', 'Water gushed into the engine room, the ship lost power, and, in a final insult, a wave slammed the Chauncey onto a reef. Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Booth sent down an order to stand by to abandon ship and, like Hunter and Calhoun before him, began weighing strategies to get his crew to shore alive. Perversely, the collision was good news for the Young. Once the Chauncey was firmly stuck on the same reef, it shielded Calhoun’s ship from some of the most turbulent waves.', 'Better still, the Chauncey was fairly close to shore—about 25 yards—and was no longer at risk of sinking. Now all the crew of the Young needed to do was get to the Chauncey, which was about 75 yards away. Members of the Chauncey’s crew succeeded in dragging a pair of lines ashore and setting up as many rafts to ferry the men through the oily waves.', 'Once ashore, the survivors climbed a steep cliff to reach the mainland. A radioman on the Chauncey named Frederick Fish later remembered finding an unconscious crew member of the Young in the water and bringing him to land.\xa0Men from the Delphy were there as well, Fish recalled—“walking about in a dreamlike daze, stumbling and falling, cutting their hands and bare feet on the jagged edges of the cliff.”', 'Looking out at the water, Fish could see the Delphy smashed against a rock and observed its crew shuttle as many men to shore as possible. Before long, Fish heard “the cries for help of an injured man who was lashed there.” That was Pearson. Blodgett from the Delphy was on shore, and he told Fish what had happened—how Pearson was blinded and strapped to the hull of the Delphy. “His calls kept up through the night, and they still ring in my brain,” Fish recalled. “To hear a fellow creature calling for help and not be able to relieve him is the crudest torture possible to man.”', 'On the Young, holding fast to its sinking hull, all the remaining men could do was look on as the crew of the Chauncey worked to save themselves before setting up a line for the other ship. Finally, someone decided not to wait any longer. Peterson, the chief boatswain’s mate, had planned to swim for the rock between the Young and the shore before the Chauncey arrived. Now he was ready to swim to the Chauncey.', 'Peterson took three lengths of line totaling more than 100 yards, found a doughnut-shaped buoy, fastened the line to it, and slipped the buoy over his head. On Calhoun’s order, he dove into the frigid water and made it to the Chauncey in a matter of minutes. A crew member recalled hearing Calhoun shout that a swimmer was coming their way. Once Peterson had been lifted aboard the Chauncey, Herzinger followed using Peterson’s line. “Had he lost his hold,” Calhoun recalled, “he would have been in fuel oil and an angry sea, and would undoubtedly have lost his life.”', 'After Herzinger made it across, the Chauncey sent back a seven-man raft. Evacuations commenced—four men on the first raft, eight on the second, ten on the others. It took 11 crossings to get everyone who could be found off the Young. Calhoun made one last inspection before boarding the final raft. “I want to state that Providence put the Chauncey ashore in that place,” Calhoun later said. “It is absolutely certain in my mind that the loss of the Chauncey saved half of the crew of my ship or more.”', 'There was one additional consolation: Fireman Scott, who had volunteered to shut down the Young’s boiler, finally reappeared at about 10:30 p.m., when the lighthouse keepers on shore heard cries for help from the bottom of the bluffs—five surviving sailors, including Scott. He’d made it off the Young and into the water but was unconscious, and when he awoke he clung to a piece of flotsam; he’d floated for an hour before being hauled aboard a raft.', 'Calhoun knew that not everyone from his ship had made it. He wondered how many still flailed in the oil-coated water. And the engine- and fire-room crews deep inside the ship: had they been trapped down below, or were they pulled out by the undertow as the ship rolled? Those men—his men—had been 150 yards from shore with no way out of the ship.', 'On shore, when Herzinger mentioned to Calhoun that the losses were great, as many as 20 or 30 sailors, the young captain’s response was grave: “My God, I know—but we will not discuss it now.”', 'The rescue efforts were just getting underway as the remaining ships neared Honda Point, still following the leader. For some it was too late to change course. One after another, they smashed into the shore—a seven-ship pileup on the California coast—hitting rocks, reefs, and, in some cases, one another.', 'The officers of the Woodbury saw lights ahead of the other ships and assumed a man was overboard. They reversed engines, but not soon enough to avoid ramming a large boulder.', 'The Nicholas struck a reef, and the pounding surf spun the boat until it pointed out to sea. The oil, the rocks, and the darkness made lowering rafts impossible; the men had to wait all night for a lifeline from shore.', 'Then came the Farragut, named for the great Civil War hero. Lieutenant Commander J. F. McClain ordered a full stop, but reversing the engines doused the ship’s lights. Suddenly, it was dark again, and the Fuller, next in the squadron line, collided with the Farragut before hitting a pinnacle rock—the same one that had claimed the Woodbury.', 'The ships at the back of Watson’s column, the Percival and the Somers, had time and space enough to change course. The last division—the Paul Hamilton, the Stoddert, and the Thompson—never took the turn into the channel.', 'Along the shore, an entire community was mobilizing to help rescue the sailors still in the water. The ships’ sirens had woken nearby residents, who loaded their cars with blankets, hot coffee, and food, and rushed to the steep bluff. A fishing captain, Giacomo Noceti, bravely ferried his boat to the edge of the rocks and retrieved some 150 men with lines. A nearby rail station became a headquarters for relief workers, who brought aid in and shipped rescued sailors out. A passing train took the injured to Santa Barbara hospitals, and later that day another transported 38 officers and 517 enlisted men to the naval base in San Diego.', 'The Delphy snapped in two just five minutes after everyone except Pearson had evacuated. The ship’s searchlight tower leaned farther over with each barrage of waves, until it dragged the rest of the ship over and down. The section of the deck where Pearson had been tied up was pulled into the ocean. He was one of the Delphy’s three casualties that night.', 'How many were lost from the rest of the fleet wouldn’t be known for hours. Through it all, Watson checked on the injured, organized search parties, tallied his men, and reported back to naval headquarters. By morning, he was preparing to send salvage parties back to the ships and arranging for the care of survivors. Even Calhoun, grappling with unspeakable losses, would later praise the commander, stating, “I only hope that if ever I am faced with the tragedy that faced him that night, I’ll be half the man that he was: cool, calm, courageous, and thoughtful; never missing an opportunity to aid.” But in idle moments, alone with his thoughts, Watson seemed to Dooman years older.', 'When a search party returned with the body of Fireman Conway, who had fallen from a rescue line into the water, Watson approached the stretcher. He raised the blanket and looked down on Conway for a long moment. Then, silently, the captain unbuckled the sword he wore and laid it beside the body.', 'Was he thinking about all the men—some 300 or so, as he estimated early on—who might be dead because of the decision he’d signed off on?', 'Was he thinking about his friend Dooman, there only because of his invitation? Or his daughter, who’d been promised a spot, and how lucky it was she hadn’t been aboard?', 'Was he thinking about his wider family? His father and the legacy of the Watsons, that night on the Hartford in 1864 and Captain Farragut’s cry of “Damn the torpedoes!”? Did he sense any connection between that historic moment and his decision to push forward at all costs?', 'There would be time for him to mull these questions—to sift through everything that had happened—later on that night, in the weeks and months to come, and for the rest of his life.', '3.', 'In the space of just ten minutes, the Navy lost more ships than it had during all of World War I. Seven destroyers ran aground, one after another, each with more than 100 men aboard. Some of them split in two on the rocks. They collided with one another. They hemorrhaged oil—some 300,000 gallons covering 800 acres.', 'Twenty-three sailors lost their lives: three on the Delphy, twenty on the Young. A miracle by some measures, a debacle by others. Of the men trapped inside the Young, most probably fought through smoke and gas, darkness and freezing water. None made it to shore. Those who didn’t drown immediately were caught in the ebbing tide and sucked out to sea.', 'The disaster was front-page news around the country. Some 10,000 people turned up for a memorial service in San Diego. A week later, hundreds of visitors from Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, and other nearby towns flocked to the cliffs above Honda Point to view the wreckage. Demand to visit the scene was so high that a special train was provided on Sunday. Many packed a lunch and remained on the bluffs all day.', 'The day after the disaster, Navy secretary Edwin Denby seized on the great Kanto earthquake as the explanation. It was because of the quake, he suggested—an act of God, with unthinkable ramifications an ocean away—that nothing went as planned on the water that day. It explained why the ships never really reached 20 knots. Usually, the current pushed ships south; on that day it pushed them north. “One of the destroyers was broken in two, and it seems as if she was carried bodily up and dropped,” Denby marveled.', 'Others blamed technology: that infuriating RDF, sending good sailors astray, undermining their expertise. “The theory was advanced by mariners,” The Washington Post reported, “that the compass bearings taken from a nearby shore station as guidance through the fog, had been transmitted erroneously.”', 'Yet to some the weather and the obscure compass readings only explained so much. The Navy scheduled an inquiry for Monday, September 17. Depending on the outcome, the next step could involve court-martials. That left a week for the press to point fingers. “There has been a peculiar reluctance on the part of officers responsible for full and prompt reports of what happened,” a New York Times editorial declared. “For the honor of the United States Navy and for the good of the service those who were responsible should be made to suffer for it.”', 'Among those who might bear responsibility, Watson was an ideal target. Not only had he been the one in charge, but he offered a newspaper-ready narrative: an admiral’s son, wealthy and connected, now facing utter disgrace. Watson and the ship commanders hunkered in San Diego, awaiting the inquiry in silence. Those close to Watson encouraged him to try and stop what was coming. His brother Loyall urged him to stand firm and defend himself. His brother-in-law, Clifford Gratz, wanted to leverage his family’s relationship with the Rockefellers to spare Watson and help stave off any embarrassment to the family. Naval Academy friends worked back channels, pleading for leniency.\xa0', 'But there was one person whose opinion mattered more than any other. On September 16, retired rear admiral John Crittenden Watson, then 80 and in fragile health, wrote to his son from his home in Washington, D.C. “I knew the saving of all the lives possible would be the greatest comfort to you and our dear Hermine,” the elder Watson wrote. “Like both of you, our thought is that you were able to save not only your own life but to assist others.”', 'With its measured tone, the admiral’s letter spoke volumes. There was no assurance of his son’s guiltlessness—no proclamation that, faced with the day’s beguiling circumstances, he would have acted the same. The message was clear: A man’s fate mattered less than his reputation. The family’s honor rested with Watson now.', 'Typically, Navy inquiries are confidential, as with a grand jury in a criminal case. But the press demanded that they be allowed to watch, and Denby relented. As the inquiry got underway, its public nature seemed more than anything to dictate what would become of Watson and his commanders. No one wished to give any impression that mercy would be shown to the men behind the worst peacetime disaster in Navy history.', 'Watson and his commanders wouldn’t be allowed to testify; as they were possible defendants in court-martial proceedings, anything they said could expose them to prosecution. Only one senior crew member of the Delphy was called to testify: Laurence Blodgett, Hunter’s second-in-command. “We were satisfied that the Arguello radio station was wrong,” Blodgett explained from the stand. “They kept giving our position north and to the west of Point Arguello, and when we could not make this check with our figures, we finally took the reciprocal of their bearings, which would show us already in the Santa Barbara Channel.” As soon as he finished, the prosecutor asked to add Blodgett to the defendant list too. His role in making navigation decisions transformed him, in the eyes of the court, from a bystander to a suspect. Off the stand he went; the defense never had a chance to cross-examine him.', 'This was a search for scapegoats—but should the ships’ commanders have expected anything different? Watson at least was desperate to have his say. Just days after the worst possible thing that could have happened on his watch came to pass, he was staring down what he considered another disaster. The men under his command—the ones who’d followed his lead—were about to lose their reputations and livelihoods. This could be why, on the inquiry’s second day, Watson made his first public comments about Honda Point. “The responsibility for the course of the destroyer squadron was mine, a responsibility which I fully realized,” he told a reporter for a news service, whose story would appear in papers around the country in the days to come. “But that decision was based upon 33 years of experience in the Navy, and made after due consideration of reports of our position from the Point Arguello radio station, which were confusing.”', 'It was part mea culpa, part dogged display. Watson continued on like this, switching from accepting blame to explaining why, given the weather and the cryptic RDF readings, anyone in his position would have done the same thing. “The condition of visibility, remember, was such that we were unable to get our true position from the stars. We were compelled to rely upon the radio station. I asked for our bearings repeatedly. From about 6:30 until 8 o’clock p.m., that most vital period in our lives, we were unable to get radio bearings from the station. I accept that responsibility. I made a naval officer’s decision. I was content the radio station was wrong. And that is why I gave the order.”', 'On September 22, Watson issued a similar statement to the court of inquiry and to the press: “The Squadron Commander hopes the responsibility for this disaster, which he considers entirely his own, may not descend upon the able and loyal subordinates who supported him on all occasions.” Watson was sacrificing himself, throwing himself into the prosecution’s line of fire. He also asked the court to waive its rule barring potential defendants from testifying—in effect, making himself more vulnerable to court-martial so that he could have his say now.', 'The court granted Watson’s request, and he was permitted to take the stand on September 24. “The responsibility was mine,” he said. “I was convinced that the station was wrong. But they were right.”', 'The court of inquiry’s president, Rear Admiral William V. Pratt, attempted to pick apart this blanket admission. “Do you feel,” he asked Watson, “that you can assume all of the responsibility that at times must fall on the shoulders of your division commanders?”', '“I have no desire to assume their responsibilities,” Watson replied. “I simply want to make clear that I assume all of my own.”', 'Watson braced himself for a public flogging. So perhaps he was as surprised as anyone when the opposite occurred. Almost overnight, the squadron commander transformed—in the eyes of the public, at least—from the incompetent scion of a naval legend to a paragon of selflessness and sacrifice. More than one newspaper editorial used the word “manliness” to describe what he’d done.', '“Capt. Watson has given a splendid example of the finest attributes of character overcoming the elemental instinct of self-preservation,” the Army and Navy Journal declared, while the San Diego Sun waxed on about Watson’s “heroic” soul. “He waits for no court martial. He relies not on lawyers. He seeks no avenue of evasion. He resorts to no subterfuge. Lest the blame rest on some innocent man, he takes upon himself full responsibility for his actions.”', 'Others around the country joined the chorus, taking Watson’s testimony as their cue to examine what true leadership really meant. “The heroism of captain Watson is of a different type,” declared the Santa Monica Evening Gazette. “It manifests itself after deliberation; after the weighing of consequences.” And this from the San Francisco Chronicle: “From the moment the ship struck, his bearing and speech have been that of a most remarkable example of real manliness under the most distressing conditions which an officer in his position can ever meet.”', 'The goodwill seemed to play a part in Watson persuading the other officers named as defendants to join him in testifying, so that they also would have the chance to recount what had happened that night. This was no small thing: By opening themselves to prosecution, these officers had to have faith that Watson’s contrition would reflect well on them. Admiral Pratt called their decision to testify “worthy of the best traditions of the Navy.”\xa0', 'When the Delphy’s skipper, Hunter, testified, he also made sure to blame the technology, as Watson had. “I’ll have to admit that it was an error in judgment,” he testified. “But as contributing causes I believe … the fact that a bilateral radio compass is used there were partly responsible.” Hunter also floated the “possibility” that “abnormal currents caused by the Japanese earthquake” contributed to the problem. In response, the lieutenant commander in charge of the Point Arguello lighthouse took the stand, defending his compass bearings that night. In fact, the readings had been within a few degrees of accuracy the whole time, even if one of them had required a reciprocal adjustment.', 'Many of Watson’s other commanders said that they weren’t responsible for what had happened because they’d been duty-bound to follow the Delphy’s lead. The Navy’s sacred adherence to chain of command suddenly was on trial, too. Robert Morris, the commander of the division of ships immediately astern of the Delphy, said that they “could not possibly be held culpable in carrying out the destroyer doctrine of following their leader.” Rear Admiral Pratt asked Morris, “Does seniority take the place of common sense?” Morris replied, “They are supposed to be synonymous.”', 'Not every skipper had hewed so tightly to that edict. Thomas A. Symington of the Thompson, the last ship in line, said that once he’d noticed the confusion of lights and sirens ahead, he slowed down to take soundings. Leslie Bratton of the Stoddert said that he’d opted to violate the no-navigation order and asked the lighthouse for radio bearings himself, then steered his ship away in time to avoid disaster. Hardy B. Page, navigator of the Hamilton, said that he’d suspected there was a problem ahead and advised his commanding officer to get word to the division commander—a decision that helped the division’s three ships escape intact.', 'Finally, the board heard from Walter Roper—the division commander who a few hours before the disaster had jousted with Watson by radio about helping the Cuba. Roper was as flinty on the stand as he’d been that night on the water. “I’m not a desk man. My experience comes from hard knocks,” he said, a jab at Watson’s lack of experience and Hunter’s academy training. “There are too many book-learned and not enough practical men running the Navy.” In Roper’s view, those on the Delphy should never have assumed that the ship really was going 20 knots in such choppy water. The error, he said, was in putting “too much reliance on computation of speed by propeller revolutions.” In his experience, he said, he’d seen propellers indicate 20 knots when the ship was in fact going only 12.', 'Roper made a point of saying that he would have heeded the lighthouse. “I have gone into the most dangerous harbors in the world through impenetrable fogs, guided almost wholly by radio compass,” he said. His division had never turned left, he testified, because he never came close to trusting the Delphy. “I was positive we had not passed Point Arguello. I did not know the forward ships were turning. Could I have seen them, I would not have followed, but instead would have tried to stop them. My motto is ‘Never try to turn a corner until you have passed.’\u202f”', 'Rear Admiral Pratt asked Roper if he would have turned left had he been on the ship behind the Delphy. “Of course I would not,” Roper said. “\u202f‘Follow the leader’ is all right, but it should be tempered with common sense. When I was a boy, our leader once jumped off a barn. I stayed put—and walked down to pick him up. He had a broken leg.” The room erupted with laughter.', 'But the fact remained that Roper failed to speak up against Watson at the time. Had he been stinging from their quarrel over the Cuba? If he’d said something—one of many ifs that night—might the entire disaster have been avoided, and 23 lives spared?', 'On October 12, the court of inquiry made its determination. Never mind the weather and the radio; the Honda Point disaster, the court ruled, was the result of “bad errors and faulty navigation.” Faced with so much uncertainty, the ships should have slowed down to take depth soundings. Following the leader may have been a Navy tradition, but it shouldn’t trump reason.', 'Eleven officers were recommended for court-martial. Watson, Hunter, and Blodgett were charged with “culpable inefficiency and negligence,” and eight others with simple negligence. But the court seemed gripped by contradictory impulses. It issued a letter to Calhoun, the Young’s commander, commending him “for coolness, intelligence, and seamanlike ability,” and to Walter D. Seed, of the Fuller, for “great bravery in swimming … about seventy five yards, through a rough and turbulent sea … for the salvage of the crew.” Yet both also faced charges of negligence.', 'The court-martial proceedings took place in rapid succession during the month of November. All eyes remained on Watson. Would his penitence spare the others? On November 7, Watson doubled down with another public statement. “I am ready and anxious to take my medicine. I don’t want an acquittal. For me to be acquitted by this court would be bad for the naval service, to which both my father and myself have devoted our lives.”', 'Calhoun, at his trial, went out of his way to commend Watson. He testified that in his opinion no power on earth could have saved the Young and the other ships after the Delphy ran aground. Calhoun insisted that he had no reason to suspect the Delphy of any errors, and testified that he and the Young’s crew would not have done anything differently had they been at the front of the line—except perhaps take soundings.', 'Watson reciprocated as a witness at Calhoun’s trial. “Every man of the crew of the Young owes his life solely and entirely to Commander Calhoun,” he testified.', 'In his summation speech in Watson’s trial, Watson’s lawyer, Thomas T. Craven, noted how, at Honda Point, “fate was indeed stern upon this occasion.” If the Delphy had continued south for just a few more minutes before turning, the entire column of ships would have cleared the rocks. If they’d turned a few minutes sooner, the coast would have been more forgiving, resulting in less damage and fewer lives lost. How many Navy men, Craven asked, had made similarly small missteps and escaped the hand of fate? Watson, he suggested, was a victim of bad luck.', 'Calhoun was acquitted after 40 minutes of deliberation. Blodgett, the Delphy’s navigator, was also acquitted, as were seven other defendants. There were just two convictions:\xa0Edward Howe Watson and Donald T. Hunter would not escape official blame for what happened that night. But considering the scale of the catastrophe, their sentences were lighter than expected. Both Watson and Hunter were allowed to continue their military careers, but with lower ranking numbers, which virtually eliminated the possibility of promotion. Neither would command a ship again, but they would retain their ranks. And the careers of the other men would be saved.', '“It is a very proper sentence,” Watson told reporters. “It is a fitting punishment. The loss of a few numbers could not be a sufficient punishment for an error as great as mine was. I am glad that the sentence is as severe as it is. It puts me very near the bottom of the list of captains, I guess. Needless to say, it does not make me happy.”', 'Watson had transformed from a villain to a hero with his admission in September. Now, in December, with his career intact, things changed again. Back Watson went, from hero to goat. Yet, by taking the blame, had Watson—no matter how gallant the gesture—simply given the Navy a smooth path toward putting the embarrassing episode behind it? And was the Navy now rewarding Watson for his contrition? After the loss of seven ships and 23 lives, how was it exactly that not one member of the Navy had lost their job?', '“Just learned court-martial has been very lenient with everybody,” President Calvin Coolidge said. Navy Secretary Denby also made sure to grumble publicly that the “sentence in [Watson’s] case is inadequate.”', 'On December 29, the Army and Navy Journal reported, “The light sentence created almost as great a sensation at Washington as the disaster.”', 'Eugene Dooman’s escape from the scene at Honda Point occurred just before dawn after the wrecks, when a train to Los Angeles approached the local station where the relief efforts were headquartered. Watson told Dooman and a few others to board it. Hundreds of other men would be taking the San Diego train a few hours later. Dooman, like many in the squadron, was covered from head to foot with oil, so a conductor placed some newspapers on the seat, and off they went. In Los Angeles, Dooman was on his own again, delivered from the tragedy—and from the official narrative.', 'The available record from the court of inquiry and Watson’s court-martial includes just one mention of a civilian on the Delphy, but Dooman’s name never appears. In the years to come, as military and civilian historians researched the Honda Point disaster, the idea of a not-spoken-for witness to the disaster proved tantalizing. He was called the “mystery guest,” the “civilian,” the “phantom passenger.” Rumors circulated that he and Watson had been drinking that day (Watson and others denied this), or that Watson subsequently swore him to silence about what really went wrong that night. But while Dooman’s identity was never well publicized, it was never really secret either. In January 1924, he gave a long interview to an English-language paper in Japan, complimenting Watson’s performance on the night of the wreck and relating the tale of his own escape. Had the historians and writers seen that article, the mystery would have been solved.', 'After 30 years as a diplomat in Tokyo, Dooman came home to America after Pearl Harbor, retiring just a few years later, in 1945. It took until the 1960s for him to be located and asked about Honda Point. “I am not competent” to pass judgment on Watson’s decisions that day, he wrote one interlocutor in 1966. “That is to say, I cannot weigh the extenuating circumstances, but a disaster did occur and the man who made the decision had to assume responsibility.”', 'Dooman was asked why he was never called to testify in the inquiry, and what happened to the $3,000 in silver he’d brought on board. The answers, it turned out, were linked. The silver was sacrificed, Dooman wrote, in the name of discretion. The money had been found in the wreckage, he wrote, “but could not be claimed without the probability of being called as a witness in the court-martial, and Watson and his defense officer were afraid that my testimony might prove harmful to Watson, since I was with him when the ship struck.” By today’s standards, these actions would have constituted a cover-up. But every answer Dooman gave seemed to prompt more questions. Why had the Navy not asked him to testify? Did his job in the State Department play a part in that decision? Or was the Navy afraid that additional testimony from a civilian passenger would add yet more unwelcome intrigue to a debacle it wished would just go away?', 'Dooman wouldn’t say. But he and Watson remained friends for years. A few days after the disaster, Dooman explained, with the inquiry not yet begun, he’d paid a visit to Watson and his wife at their home in San Diego. (Some armchair historians, parsing the disaster’s themes of negligence and culpability, have gone so far as to wonder if the captain reimbursed Dooman his lost $3,000 in return for his discretion. If such a thing occurred, Dooman never mentioned it.) The Watsons would later visit Japan, in 1937, and dine with Dooman there. He curtly alluded to the price Watson paid for the tragedy, the toll it took on him. “After the disaster,” Dooman wrote, “he lost his zest for living and became very despondent.”', 'Just after the court-martial, Dooman wrote a letter to Watson, one of dozens sent by friends and well-wishers hoping to soften the blow. “Do you know what a splendid impression you have made on everybody,” the diplomat wrote from Washington, “not only those high in the Navy but the man in the street? I dined with Admiral Knight who said splendid things about you. I think you will appreciate even more, though, what I overheard in the cars the other day—‘Well,’ said one, ‘I don’t get this stuff about the compass, but as long as we have fellows in the Navy like this guy who took the blame we shouldn’t worry.’\u202f”', 'William Calhoun was cleared of any blame for the Young’s tragedy; he was even commended for his cool demeanor during the rescue. But the loss of 20 men weighed heavily on him, and for a time it seemed foolish to assume that Calhoun would command a ship again. Eventually, however, his career righted itself. After serving on several ships, further instruction at the Naval War College, and a stint as an instructor at the Naval Academy, Calhoun returned to sea as commanding officer of the USS Rochester, and later the USS California. In 1938, he was promoted to rear admiral. The next year, he became commander of the Navy’s Pacific base in Honolulu and remained in that position through World War II. “There was nothing the fleet wanted that Uncle Bill wouldn’t get,” one commander would say.', 'Calhoun retired in 1946 a four-star admiral, after 44 years of active service. There was just one thing missing from his time at sea: He never saw battle. For that he’d be granted some satisfaction from the author James A. Michener, who’d been a lieutenant commander under Calhoun during the war. “Those of us who worked for Uncle Billy believed that he had played a major role in smothering the Japanese with matériel,” Michener wrote in his memoirs, “and the fighting admirals agreed.” In Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific—the Pulitzer Prize–winning basis for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical—Calhoun is said to be the model for Millard Kester, a grounded admiral who finally gets to do battle at sea, leading an entire invasion force. And winning.', 'Calhoun died in 1963; he had married and was a grandfather many times over. In 1984, some 61 years after the disaster, a scuba diver and amateur treasure hunter exploring the California coast noticed something shiny on the ocean floor, churned up by a recent storm: a class ring from the Naval Academy. It didn’t take long to connect the ring to its deceased owner. The diver had hoped to make some money for a discovery from the site of the disaster. One collector offered him $1,500. Then a fellow diver let him know that Calhoun’s widow, Rosalie, was alive and living in Coronado, near San Diego. Her phone number was listed. He agreed to sell the ring to her for $400—the cost of the dive, he said.', 'Rosalie had never remarried. The ring, when the diver handed it over, stirred something in her. “It’s like part of him was brought back,” she said, filled with emotion for her lost husband.', 'On December 14, 1923, six days after Edward Howe Watson’s conviction in a Navy court-martial, his father, retired admiral John Crittenden Watson, died at 81. A fellow retired admiral, Colby M. Chester, wrote to the younger Watson that same day: “Your name was the last one uttered by your father, and I know how happy the Honda affair made him.” Happy that\xa0his son’s career was intact, perhaps. Or that the family name had, despite everything, retained some of its dignity.\xa0', 'On January 10, 1924, Watson along with his wife and daughter moved to Honolulu, where he was stationed until his retirement five years later. In the 1930s, the Watsons lived in New York and then in Jamestown, Rhode Island, visiting Japan several times. In the years before World War II, Watson indulged his fascination with Japan, writing poems about historic Japanese figures. That other existence he might have led before Honda Point—the life of a sly and insightful Navy attaché, drawing out spies and supplying Washington with essential information about a potentially lethal foe—seemed to loom large for him.', 'In the late 1930s, Watson drafted a long policy memo about Japan to a friend at the Naval War College, still hoping someone would heed his warnings—“stuff that I have worked up during the past 5 years, since my retirement,” as he described it. “Perhaps it will help to save many hours to some fellow who is doing a bit of research work on the subject. Dispose of it as your judgment dictates. Either in the files or by burning.”', 'Watson died of heart disease in a Navy hospital on January 7, 1942, a month to the day after Pearl Harbor proved his point. His family later said that they thought the attack had hastened his death. Honda Point was not mentioned in any of his published obituaries.', 'Watson had pursued a life of significance, of honor. At Honda Point, the son emulated the father, following the traditions of leadership codified by an entire generation—and those same traditions contributed to the disaster. But after the worst happened, and the nation had judged him, he chose to preserve his character. In doing so, he acquired a different kind of significance, one he hadn’t expected.', 'In his papers, there is a letter from Watson’s father written on October 1, 1923, just after Watson had publicly accepted responsibility for the error that cost the Navy seven ships and 23 lives. In its tone, the letter was far warmer and more effusive than the one that had preceded it. “I cannot express in any words how proud we are of you and of your devoted wife,” the father wrote.', 'In the letter, Watson’s father offered his son a gift. He said that a relative of the late Admiral David Farragut had written to him “to express his confidence in you,” and sent along a precious keepsake: a makeshift tourniquet the elder Watson had made aboard the Hartford during the Civil War, “just as we were about to pass up the Mississippi by the Confederate batteries.”', 'Farragut had given this rag—a relic of John Crittenden’s most glorious moment in the Navy—to his own son “to use in case of a wound.” Now it seemed that someone else had a better use for it. “When I wrote him I know you would love to have it, he sent it to me,” Watson’s father wrote. “I will hold it for you until you come East. All of us join in ever much love to all three of you.”', 'And so Edward Howe Watson was offered a tourniquet—a message from father to son. His son was wounded and needed care. His son was worthy of greatness. His son was a Watson. And in court his son had not shirked from his duty to do what the father never had to do: go down with his ship.', '© 2023 The Atavist Magazine.

This was a chance, maybe his last, to prove himself at sea.': ['For Watson, it was no small thing to run into a friend from Tokyo. Japan was Watson’s last posting before taking command of Squadron 11. His time there may have been the most successful of his career. Decades later, a colleague called Watson “one of the most likable and dynamic, intelligent and alert naval attachés we have had in any country.”', 'Watson arrived in Tokyo in 1919 with orders to monitor the country’s designs on expansion. Japan had been making strides toward imperialism, and Washington was determined to maintain U.S. influence around the world after the war. Watson’s predecessor left him with very little in the way of intel, forcing him to start with next to nothing. But after hosting parties for his Japanese counterparts, Watson discovered that he had a knack for eliciting information. His technique, as later described by an underling, was “telling them too much so that they could learn too little.” Japanese officers found Watson’s chattiness mystifying, and disarming. He produced memos full of policy insights—many of which proved especially useful leading up to an international disarmament conference Japanese officials attended in Washington in late 1921. And he exposed attempts by the Japanese to bribe Navy officers for information.', 'Watson was making a name for himself for the first time, excelling at a game his father, the illustrious Civil War hero, had never played—a modern, 20th-century pastime, built for an age of global politics. Beyond his canny way with people, Watson also had a knack for seeing around corners. He insisted that the U.S. counter Japan’s efforts to control the Pacific, and when Washington failed to follow some of his recommendations, he issued a dire prophecy. “If we know the minute details of Japanese plans for aggression,” Watson said in 1922, “we are in a position to thwart them while they are still in the planning stage… Otherwise we shall one day be confronted with a surprise that will hit us right between the eyes.”', 'Watson seemed well positioned for the life of a diplomat, proto-spy, and statesman. All that ended abruptly when he received a promotion to command a squadron of destroyers. His career lurched back onto a familiar track—his father’s trajectory, the family business. Not without some regret, he returned home. Watson was coming up on 50 years old. This was a chance, maybe his last, to prove himself at sea.', 'Now Watson’s two paths were converging, or at least bumping up against each other for a day. At the very moment he was called upon to show his stuff as a naval commander, he also had the chance to catch up with a trusted colleague from his time in the Far East. The timing was even more welcome given how, just a week earlier, Japan had experienced a once-in-a-lifetime catastrophe. The great Kanto earthquake—even today the most lethal natural disaster by far in the nation’s history—had laid waste to much of Yokohama and Tokyo, followed by typhoon-fueled fires and powerful tsunamis. More than 100,000 deaths were estimated, and Tokyo was under martial law. Many around the world, Watson included, were anxious to hear what had been destroyed, how many lives lost. On the water, he and Dooman would have time to talk about it all.', '2.', 'Patches of sun broke through the San Francisco fog on the morning of Saturday, September 8, as Watson’s ships set off down the coast. Fourteen of the squadron’s destroyers would take part in the exercise, divided into three divisions, with Watson aboard the Delphy in front. The Delphy would handle navigation for all the ships. The others would follow the leader, just like many great Navy squadrons before them, including Farragut’s in Mobile Bay.', 'They hit a wall of haze at 8 a.m., but the gunnery exercises took place as scheduled. At 11:30 a.m., the crew of the Delphy spotted a lighthouse at Pigeon Point, one of several shore locations ships used for a visual fix. All seemed well. But this would be the last time that day anyone would be able to see land.', 'The weather was changing—first fog, then more haze. For the rest of the afternoon, the Delphy’s crew used dead reckoning to estimate its position. Lieutenant Commander Donald T. Hunter, the Delphy’s skipper, had taught navigation for two years at the Naval Academy. The California shoreline did not present much of a challenge. Based on the ship’s estimated speed of 20 knots and the typical currents, Hunter, working alongside the ship’s navigator, Lieutenant Laurence Blodgett, calculated their location and continued hurtling down the coast.', 'But a few hours passed and still no visibility. The Delphy had one more tool to assist with navigation: a radio device that allowed ships to request compass bearings from shore stations. Radio direction finding, or RDF, was still in its infancy—it would be the precursor to radar, which wouldn’t come to ships for more than a decade—but the technology had been a great help during the war, detecting the location of German submarines when they surfaced to send wireless transmissions. After the war, RDF had been slow to catch on. While a number of lighthouses up and down the East and West Coast were equipped with it, ships like the Delphy had only a clunky-looking circular antenna on board. Upon request, a\xa0lighthouse worker would use an RDF device to send a signal to the ship’s antenna, then contact the ship by traditional radio to\xa0provide a compass reading.  If a lighthouse was, say, due east from a ship, a navigator could use that reading to calculate the ship’s position. The system was far from ideal. There was, in fact, no way to tell which side of the looped antenna the station had detected, which meant that every reading came with an opposite possible “reciprocal” bearing. A bearing of due east sometimes really meant due west; it was up to the navigator to discern which was most likely correct.', 'To many seasoned Navy officers, RDF seemed almost foolish. What navigator worth his salt would trust dubious readings from a lighthouse jockey and a loop of wire over his own calculations? Hunter, who’d once famously made his way into an Alaskan port through a blinding fog, usually had little use for RDF. But three hours was a long time to go without seeing anything, so at 2:15 p.m. Hunter had his crew contact the only RDF-equipped station along the route—the lighthouse at Point Arguello, at the edge of the rugged coast that jutted out 80 miles northwest of Santa Barbara.', 'A radioman at the lighthouse sent back a compass reading: 167 degrees. This suggested that the ship had already passed Point Arguello, which was obviously wrong; they hadn’t been on the water nearly long enough. Hunter asked for a repeat bearing and got a similar reading. Meanwhile, the crew still weren’t able to see anything on the shore to confirm their position. When Blodgett, Hunter’s second-in-command, suggested moving closer to the coast to improve visibility, Hunter said no—that would force them to slow down and scuttle the squadron’s speed exercise. Instead, Hunter questioned the lighthouse radioman, radioing back that they were north of Point Arguello. The radioman supplied the reciprocal reading. That seemed to produce reasonable verification that they were where they thought they were.', 'For consequential calls like this one, Hunter turned to Watson, his commander, for approval. For much of the day, Watson had stayed off the bridge; by at least one account, he’d spent that time in his quarters, in conversation with Dooman, stepping out every hour or so to sign off on Hunter’s decisions. Watson agreed with his captain that they were where dead reckoning placed them—that the RDF had to be wrong. They continued on, the Delphy in front, 13 destroyers following. But their location on the route was hardly a trivial concern. Point Arguello marked the spot where Watson’s ships needed to turn left into the Santa Barbara Channel. If they turned too soon, they risked running headlong into Honda Point.', 'Everyone on the ships knew about Honda Point—a hook of land jutting out from the coast a few miles north of the entrance of the Santa Barbara Channel. The shore along Honda Point is made up of sharp igneous rock and steep bluffs with few beaches. The waves are relentless, and boulders and reefs lurk below the waterline like booby traps. Its original name, Point Pedernales, was from the Spanish como un pedernal, or “like flint.” Some referred to it as the Devil’s Jaw.', 'Then, as if to demonstrate the hazards ahead of them, news came of a crisis in the channel. Another vessel—not a Navy ship, but a steamer called the Cuba—had run aground that morning in the fog along the rocky shore of San Miguel Island, at the channel’s southern boundary. The Cuba had been full of passengers; a hundred people were floating in lifeboats or had already made it to shore. One of Watson’s division commanders, Walter G. Roper, aboard the destroyer Kennedy, asked to join the relief efforts.', 'Watson refused. The squadron had its orders, and another ship had already been sent to the Cuba’s aid. Watson thought it best to stay out of the way of the rescue operation, along with the rocks where the Cuba ran aground. He and Roper argued about it over the squadron’s party line—which meant that other crew members on Roper’s ship heard the exchange—and finally Roper relented.', 'For generations, the Navy had allowed its commanders extraordinary leeway in decision-making. It was standard procedure not to second-guess the man in charge. This was the ethos Watson grew up with, his father’s credo. He believed that his squadron needed him to lead, especially as the weather got worse—fog, rain, buckling waves, and the coast nowhere in sight. ', 'One of Watson’s ships, the John Francis Burnes, had dropped out of the exercise with a boiler problem. That was unfortunate, but for Hunter and Watson it was no reason for the rest of the squadron to slow down. At 4:27 p.m., with the fog even thicker, Watson ordered the remaining destroyers to assume a column formation, each boat following the one in front by sight, with just a few dozen yards between them. ', 'At 5 p.m. the sun came out briefly, but Hunter still couldn’t make out the horizon through the haze. Watson’s column of ships continued on for three more hours, unable to tell exactly where they were, yet confident they were far enough south of Honda Point.', 'At 8:35 p.m., the Delphy received another compass reading from the Point Arguello lighthouse. This time it placed them well north of the channel entrance. Watson, summoned to the bridge after dining with Dooman, couldn’t believe it. How could they have traveled all day and still be so far from the channel?', 'The more Watson thought it over, the less he trusted RDF. They were again faced with a choice: trust the new technology, or trust dead reckoning. And once again, they had a solution available to them that made sense of the confusing information they’d received: the reciprocal compass reading. When they flipped the RDF compass point, yet again the Delphy was where dead reckoning placed it. Problem solved, it seemed.', 'The Delphy’s navigator, Blodgett, knew that there was another tool they could use to make sure the ship had reached the channel: a fathometer, which measures depth. A shallow reading would mean the Delphy was too close to the coast to safely turn. Blodgett wanted to do a depth sounding. Hunter said it wasn’t necessary. And of course, to do a sounding they’d have to slow down.', 'Watson affirmed Hunter’s conclusion. He agreed that they had passed Point Arguello. This meant that the clock was ticking: To wait any longer would risk the ship hitting the far side of the channel, repeating the Cuba’s mistake. And so at 8:45 p.m., the Delphy laid plans for a 55-degree course change to port—a left turn, straight into the channel. Watson returned to his quarters.', 'From the bridge, Hunter could see the lights of ten or more ships behind him in the dark. Maybe visibility wasn’t so bad after all? But then, just after the turn, the\xa0Delphy plunged once again into a thick fog bank. The men on board couldn’t see a thing.', 'Two boats behind the Delphy on the Young, William Calhoun still couldn’t make out the lights from Point Arguello. Perhaps the fog was too thick, or the Young too far from shore? But he did see the lights of the Delphy and the S.P. Lee, just ahead, and some of the other ships behind. So he continued to follow the leader.', 'Then came a jolt to the ship—not so much heard as felt, a slight trembling in the hull. At once, Calhoun thought they’d been rammed, but by what? He rushed to the bridge just in time for a second jolt. There was nothing slight about this one. The Young’s navigator had lurched out of the formation—technically the correct reaction for a ship running aground—only to slam into something harder.', 'Right away the Young started to list, its engine room filling with water through a gash in the hull. It took just seconds for the entire destroyer to lean about 30 degrees. Then the power went out. Between the darkness and the fog, no one could see a thing. By the time Calhoun ordered his executive officer, Lieutenant Eugene Herzinger, to pass the word to stand by to abandon ship, the ship was listing nearly 45 degrees. This meant that the lifeboats were no longer an option—they were completely submerged.', 'Calhoun was left with one narrow hope: that the Young could somehow settle against whatever it was they’d rammed into and avoid sinking entirely.', 'He crawled up to the ship’s port side, which had now risen out of the water. The hull was coated in oil, and so slick that the crew that made it up there before him now had nothing to hang on to. Some had fallen into the water, and there seemed to be no way of helping them. To follow them in would doom them all.', 'And so Calhoun retracted his own order to stand by to abandon ship and told everyone around him to spread the word to gather on the port side, and above all not to jump into the water. “Don’t leave her—she is on the rocks!” Calhoun cried. “She can’t sink. Stick and you’ll be saved!”', 'On the Delphy, Dooman was with Watson in the captain’s quarters when a noise came from beneath the ship. That scrape of metal against rock was unmistakable. Even he, a civilian, knew that they had hit bottom.', 'Then came the crash. The ship lurched, sending both Dooman and Watson toppling and shattering the glass of the portholes. Dooman was thrown against the window at his back. Drawers jumped out of cabinets, papers flew, everything not nailed down was suddenly somewhere else. Without a word Watson dashed to the bridge, leaving Dooman alone.', 'The bridge was in chaos. As far as Watson and Hunter were concerned, there was only one possibility: They’d gone too far ahead, hitting the same spot that claimed the Cuba, San Miguel Island. They’d soon learn how wrong they were. But in that moment, Watson ordered two radio messages to the other ships: “keep clear to the westward” and “nine turn”—turn to port, where he thought the others could still get to the channel.', 'The collision with the rocks had sent the bow of the Delphy high into the air. Waves swung the ship around so that it was now astride the beach, braced against a series of rock outcroppings. Each new surge sent the vessel into spasms, quickly rupturing the hull. Down-the-line ships had followed the Delphy’s lead. The S.P. Lee swung around to the side of the shore and halted. The Young was next, lurching sideways and sinking; it smashed into the shore just moments before the Delphy and was almost gone. Watson could only guess what was in store for the other ships—maybe the rocky shore would claim them all.', 'There was a more immediate concern, however. The waves  slamming the Delphy repeatedly into the rocks had caused the fuel tanks to rupture. Hunter knew that the oil burners were still operational, making a boiler explosion all but imminent. He shut the master fuel valve from the bridge and ordered all crew in the engine room and the steaming fire rooms to lift the safety valves before coming up. By then the ship was pounding the rocks so violently that Hunter knew it was only a matter of time before it broke up and sank.', 'That was when Hunter asked Watson for permission to give the abandon ship order. Watson was quick to agree. But abandon for what? Oil from the Delphy was gushing into the surrounding water. The sea was a thick stew, with a five-inch slick on the surface, making swimming near impossible.', 'Back in Watson’s quarters, Dooman could hear the ship’s siren. He ran out on deck in time to see the Delphy’s searchlight beaming the water. He saw another ship crash, then another. He heard sirens and saw searchlights from those, too—ship after ship—and knew there had to be more behind them.', 'With men rushing everywhere and sirens wailing, a thought gripped Dooman: the silver. He stopped an officer, who told him that the lower part of the Delphy had flooded; this included the guest cabin where Dooman was staying. In any case, the silver was too heavy to carry if he needed to swim to safety. Dooman hurried back to Watson’s cabin. He sat down and waited, unsure of what to do next, or if he’d been forgotten completely.', 'The men on the top deck with Hunter were desperate to get off the ship. Some of the crew had braved the sludgy water and made it to an outcropping about 15 feet from shore; others became mired in the water, only to be pulled back onto the Delphy. Blodgett worked to set up a rope the men could use as a guide to the outcropping. Not everyone made it: Fireman Third Class James W. H. Conway and Cabin Cook Sofronio Dalida both died in the water.', 'Worst of all was the slow-motion tragedy of Fireman J. T. Pearson, who leapt overboard to help save three men in the water, shattered his glasses, and was blinded by the shards. Pearson cried for help and was pulled back aboard the Delphy. He was hysterical with pain and panic, and had taken in so much seawater and fuel that he fell to the deck. Blodgett held a flashlight as a pharmacist’s mate worked to remove the glass from Pearson’s eyes, to no avail. The ship was slick with oil, and equipment was flying everywhere, making it impossible to get Pearson onto a raft without endangering more lives.', 'Left with no other choice, Blodgett ordered a radioman to lash Pearson to the Delphy’s searchlight tower—what appeared to be a safe place amidships, forward of where the waves were breaking over the hull. They used a signal line that was tight enough to secure him, but not so tight that he couldn’t free himself if he regained his faculties.', 'The plan was to come back and evacuate him; that never happened. The waves raged into the night as, from the shore, the men of the Delphy could hear his repeated screams.', 'Calhoun didn’t know how long he had before the Young  would sink. The ship had tilted fully onto its side in practically no time at all; Calhoun later put it at just 90 seconds from the moment they ran aground. Now his ship was sliced open on the starboard side, with just two feet of the port side still above the surface of the water.', 'With the port side now the Young’s deck, some 80 men gripped the smashed portholes of the ship’s hull. Many were barefoot and wore what they’d gone to sleep in; some were tied to one another with lines. They waited for rescue as the waves crashed against the ship.', 'Calhoun knew that he hadn’t time for his men to put on life preservers and file into lifeboats: Like Hunter on the Delphy, he was aware that the active burners could explode the boiler, igniting the oil in the water around them. He asked for a volunteer to extinguish the burners. Fireman I.T. Scott came forward, then rushed below.', 'Minutes passed and Scott didn’t return. Had he cut the boiler? Did he escape the ship? Calhoun had no way to know for sure.', 'Calhoun’s executive officer, Gene Herzinger, and Chief Boatswain’s Mate Arthur Peterson climbed up and out from a bridge window. Peterson found an axe and smashed the portholes, providing the crew with handholds as the sea inundated the deck. They were 100 yards from shore, too far to risk swimming amid the oily waves and jagged rocks.', 'Or was it? Peterson wanted to try. He grabbed a life preserver and some rope and volunteered to swim for a large rock nearby. If he could reach that spot with the line, the other men could use it to get there, too, and they’d be that much closer to shore.', 'They were working through a plan when the Chauncey came into view. Calhoun nearly panicked. All it would take was one strong wake to shove the Young off its perch on the rock. The Chauncey got close enough to hear the Young’s crew—Calhoun loudest of them all—shouting not to collide with their sinking ship.', 'The Delphy’s lights went out. Alone in Watson’s quarters, Dooman couldn’t see a thing. He’d have no choice but to abandon the valise. Dooman returned to the deck, frightened but also appalled to have been forgotten.', 'The ship was low in the sea, and water swamped the deck. Dooman saw some of the crew at the stern, which appeared to be angled higher than the rest of the ship. Higher seemed safer, so he made his way in that direction, pulling himself along by the torpedo rails as waves smashed the deck. When Dooman arrived at the back of the Delphy, he saw that the men had run a line between the ship and a large rock 40 feet from shore. He also saw how dangerous it was—some who’d attempted the crossing had been flung into the water—and he was afraid to risk his life.', 'Dooman decided to run back to the front of the ship, until an officer shined a flashlight in his face. “You’re the passenger,” the officer said. It seemed that Dooman hadn’t been forgotten after all. He asked the man for help, and with the help of another sailor they found a raft stored on deck. They threw it over the side and jumped in, only to realize that it remained lashed to the Delphy. They were stuck. The ship slammed into the tiny craft, threatening to crash on top of them.', 'Dooman had a small penknife attached to his watch chain. He handed it to the sailor, who hacked through the line. With some effort, the raft made it over the waves to the rock. From there they were able to walk to land when the tide receded. One by one, Dooman and the others reached safety.', 'Watson finally made it across the line at 11 p.m. With one exception—Lieutenant Pearson, blinded and lashed to the rigging of a capsized, disintegrating vessel—the captain was the last to leave his ship.', 'The Chauncey threw all its power into reverse, but it was stuck with competing mandates—to avoid a collision with the Young, and to avoid the cliffs of Honda Point. In the end it hit the Young: The undertow hurled the Chauncey’s stern up against the destroyer’s port propeller blades, which ripped into the Chauncey’s starboard hull.', 'Water gushed into the engine room, the ship lost power, and, in a final insult, a wave slammed the Chauncey onto a reef. Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Booth sent down an order to stand by to abandon ship and, like Hunter and Calhoun before him, began weighing strategies to get his crew to shore alive. Perversely, the collision was good news for the Young. Once the Chauncey was firmly stuck on the same reef, it shielded Calhoun’s ship from some of the most turbulent waves.', 'Better still, the Chauncey was fairly close to shore—about 25 yards—and was no longer at risk of sinking. Now all the crew of the Young needed to do was get to the Chauncey, which was about 75 yards away. Members of the Chauncey’s crew succeeded in dragging a pair of lines ashore and setting up as many rafts to ferry the men through the oily waves.', 'Once ashore, the survivors climbed a steep cliff to reach the mainland. A radioman on the Chauncey named Frederick Fish later remembered finding an unconscious crew member of the Young in the water and bringing him to land.\xa0Men from the Delphy were there as well, Fish recalled—“walking about in a dreamlike daze, stumbling and falling, cutting their hands and bare feet on the jagged edges of the cliff.”', 'Looking out at the water, Fish could see the Delphy smashed against a rock and observed its crew shuttle as many men to shore as possible. Before long, Fish heard “the cries for help of an injured man who was lashed there.” That was Pearson. Blodgett from the Delphy was on shore, and he told Fish what had happened—how Pearson was blinded and strapped to the hull of the Delphy. “His calls kept up through the night, and they still ring in my brain,” Fish recalled. “To hear a fellow creature calling for help and not be able to relieve him is the crudest torture possible to man.”', 'On the Young, holding fast to its sinking hull, all the remaining men could do was look on as the crew of the Chauncey worked to save themselves before setting up a line for the other ship. Finally, someone decided not to wait any longer. Peterson, the chief boatswain’s mate, had planned to swim for the rock between the Young and the shore before the Chauncey arrived. Now he was ready to swim to the Chauncey.', 'Peterson took three lengths of line totaling more than 100 yards, found a doughnut-shaped buoy, fastened the line to it, and slipped the buoy over his head. On Calhoun’s order, he dove into the frigid water and made it to the Chauncey in a matter of minutes. A crew member recalled hearing Calhoun shout that a swimmer was coming their way. Once Peterson had been lifted aboard the Chauncey, Herzinger followed using Peterson’s line. “Had he lost his hold,” Calhoun recalled, “he would have been in fuel oil and an angry sea, and would undoubtedly have lost his life.”', 'After Herzinger made it across, the Chauncey sent back a seven-man raft. Evacuations commenced—four men on the first raft, eight on the second, ten on the others. It took 11 crossings to get everyone who could be found off the Young. Calhoun made one last inspection before boarding the final raft. “I want to state that Providence put the Chauncey ashore in that place,” Calhoun later said. “It is absolutely certain in my mind that the loss of the Chauncey saved half of the crew of my ship or more.”', 'There was one additional consolation: Fireman Scott, who had volunteered to shut down the Young’s boiler, finally reappeared at about 10:30 p.m., when the lighthouse keepers on shore heard cries for help from the bottom of the bluffs—five surviving sailors, including Scott. He’d made it off the Young and into the water but was unconscious, and when he awoke he clung to a piece of flotsam; he’d floated for an hour before being hauled aboard a raft.', 'Calhoun knew that not everyone from his ship had made it. He wondered how many still flailed in the oil-coated water. And the engine- and fire-room crews deep inside the ship: had they been trapped down below, or were they pulled out by the undertow as the ship rolled? Those men—his men—had been 150 yards from shore with no way out of the ship.', 'On shore, when Herzinger mentioned to Calhoun that the losses were great, as many as 20 or 30 sailors, the young captain’s response was grave: “My God, I know—but we will not discuss it now.”', 'The rescue efforts were just getting underway as the remaining ships neared Honda Point, still following the leader. For some it was too late to change course. One after another, they smashed into the shore—a seven-ship pileup on the California coast—hitting rocks, reefs, and, in some cases, one another.', 'The officers of the Woodbury saw lights ahead of the other ships and assumed a man was overboard. They reversed engines, but not soon enough to avoid ramming a large boulder.', 'The Nicholas struck a reef, and the pounding surf spun the boat until it pointed out to sea. The oil, the rocks, and the darkness made lowering rafts impossible; the men had to wait all night for a lifeline from shore.', 'Then came the Farragut, named for the great Civil War hero. Lieutenant Commander J. F. McClain ordered a full stop, but reversing the engines doused the ship’s lights. Suddenly, it was dark again, and the Fuller, next in the squadron line, collided with the Farragut before hitting a pinnacle rock—the same one that had claimed the Woodbury.', 'The ships at the back of Watson’s column, the Percival and the Somers, had time and space enough to change course. The last division—the Paul Hamilton, the Stoddert, and the Thompson—never took the turn into the channel.', 'Along the shore, an entire community was mobilizing to help rescue the sailors still in the water. The ships’ sirens had woken nearby residents, who loaded their cars with blankets, hot coffee, and food, and rushed to the steep bluff. A fishing captain, Giacomo Noceti, bravely ferried his boat to the edge of the rocks and retrieved some 150 men with lines. A nearby rail station became a headquarters for relief workers, who brought aid in and shipped rescued sailors out. A passing train took the injured to Santa Barbara hospitals, and later that day another transported 38 officers and 517 enlisted men to the naval base in San Diego.', 'The Delphy snapped in two just five minutes after everyone except Pearson had evacuated. The ship’s searchlight tower leaned farther over with each barrage of waves, until it dragged the rest of the ship over and down. The section of the deck where Pearson had been tied up was pulled into the ocean. He was one of the Delphy’s three casualties that night.', 'How many were lost from the rest of the fleet wouldn’t be known for hours. Through it all, Watson checked on the injured, organized search parties, tallied his men, and reported back to naval headquarters. By morning, he was preparing to send salvage parties back to the ships and arranging for the care of survivors. Even Calhoun, grappling with unspeakable losses, would later praise the commander, stating, “I only hope that if ever I am faced with the tragedy that faced him that night, I’ll be half the man that he was: cool, calm, courageous, and thoughtful; never missing an opportunity to aid.” But in idle moments, alone with his thoughts, Watson seemed to Dooman years older.', 'When a search party returned with the body of Fireman Conway, who had fallen from a rescue line into the water, Watson approached the stretcher. He raised the blanket and looked down on Conway for a long moment. Then, silently, the captain unbuckled the sword he wore and laid it beside the body.', 'Was he thinking about all the men—some 300 or so, as he estimated early on—who might be dead because of the decision he’d signed off on?', 'Was he thinking about his friend Dooman, there only because of his invitation? Or his daughter, who’d been promised a spot, and how lucky it was she hadn’t been aboard?', 'Was he thinking about his wider family? His father and the legacy of the Watsons, that night on the Hartford in 1864 and Captain Farragut’s cry of “Damn the torpedoes!”? Did he sense any connection between that historic moment and his decision to push forward at all costs?', 'There would be time for him to mull these questions—to sift through everything that had happened—later on that night, in the weeks and months to come, and for the rest of his life.', '3.', 'In the space of just ten minutes, the Navy lost more ships than it had during all of World War I. Seven destroyers ran aground, one after another, each with more than 100 men aboard. Some of them split in two on the rocks. They collided with one another. They hemorrhaged oil—some 300,000 gallons covering 800 acres.', 'Twenty-three sailors lost their lives: three on the Delphy, twenty on the Young. A miracle by some measures, a debacle by others. Of the men trapped inside the Young, most probably fought through smoke and gas, darkness and freezing water. None made it to shore. Those who didn’t drown immediately were caught in the ebbing tide and sucked out to sea.', 'The disaster was front-page news around the country. Some 10,000 people turned up for a memorial service in San Diego. A week later, hundreds of visitors from Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, and other nearby towns flocked to the cliffs above Honda Point to view the wreckage. Demand to visit the scene was so high that a special train was provided on Sunday. Many packed a lunch and remained on the bluffs all day.', 'The day after the disaster, Navy secretary Edwin Denby seized on the great Kanto earthquake as the explanation. It was because of the quake, he suggested—an act of God, with unthinkable ramifications an ocean away—that nothing went as planned on the water that day. It explained why the ships never really reached 20 knots. Usually, the current pushed ships south; on that day it pushed them north. “One of the destroyers was broken in two, and it seems as if she was carried bodily up and dropped,” Denby marveled.', 'Others blamed technology: that infuriating RDF, sending good sailors astray, undermining their expertise. “The theory was advanced by mariners,” The Washington Post reported, “that the compass bearings taken from a nearby shore station as guidance through the fog, had been transmitted erroneously.”', 'Yet to some the weather and the obscure compass readings only explained so much. The Navy scheduled an inquiry for Monday, September 17. Depending on the outcome, the next step could involve court-martials. That left a week for the press to point fingers. “There has been a peculiar reluctance on the part of officers responsible for full and prompt reports of what happened,” a New York Times editorial declared. “For the honor of the United States Navy and for the good of the service those who were responsible should be made to suffer for it.”', 'Among those who might bear responsibility, Watson was an ideal target. Not only had he been the one in charge, but he offered a newspaper-ready narrative: an admiral’s son, wealthy and connected, now facing utter disgrace. Watson and the ship commanders hunkered in San Diego, awaiting the inquiry in silence. Those close to Watson encouraged him to try and stop what was coming. His brother Loyall urged him to stand firm and defend himself. His brother-in-law, Clifford Gratz, wanted to leverage his family’s relationship with the Rockefellers to spare Watson and help stave off any embarrassment to the family. Naval Academy friends worked back channels, pleading for leniency.\xa0', 'But there was one person whose opinion mattered more than any other. On September 16, retired rear admiral John Crittenden Watson, then 80 and in fragile health, wrote to his son from his home in Washington, D.C. “I knew the saving of all the lives possible would be the greatest comfort to you and our dear Hermine,” the elder Watson wrote. “Like both of you, our thought is that you were able to save not only your own life but to assist others.”', 'With its measured tone, the admiral’s letter spoke volumes. There was no assurance of his son’s guiltlessness—no proclamation that, faced with the day’s beguiling circumstances, he would have acted the same. The message was clear: A man’s fate mattered less than his reputation. The family’s honor rested with Watson now.', 'Typically, Navy inquiries are confidential, as with a grand jury in a criminal case. But the press demanded that they be allowed to watch, and Denby relented. As the inquiry got underway, its public nature seemed more than anything to dictate what would become of Watson and his commanders. No one wished to give any impression that mercy would be shown to the men behind the worst peacetime disaster in Navy history.', 'Watson and his commanders wouldn’t be allowed to testify; as they were possible defendants in court-martial proceedings, anything they said could expose them to prosecution. Only one senior crew member of the Delphy was called to testify: Laurence Blodgett, Hunter’s second-in-command. “We were satisfied that the Arguello radio station was wrong,” Blodgett explained from the stand. “They kept giving our position north and to the west of Point Arguello, and when we could not make this check with our figures, we finally took the reciprocal of their bearings, which would show us already in the Santa Barbara Channel.” As soon as he finished, the prosecutor asked to add Blodgett to the defendant list too. His role in making navigation decisions transformed him, in the eyes of the court, from a bystander to a suspect. Off the stand he went; the defense never had a chance to cross-examine him.', 'This was a search for scapegoats—but should the ships’ commanders have expected anything different? Watson at least was desperate to have his say. Just days after the worst possible thing that could have happened on his watch came to pass, he was staring down what he considered another disaster. The men under his command—the ones who’d followed his lead—were about to lose their reputations and livelihoods. This could be why, on the inquiry’s second day, Watson made his first public comments about Honda Point. “The responsibility for the course of the destroyer squadron was mine, a responsibility which I fully realized,” he told a reporter for a news service, whose story would appear in papers around the country in the days to come. “But that decision was based upon 33 years of experience in the Navy, and made after due consideration of reports of our position from the Point Arguello radio station, which were confusing.”', 'It was part mea culpa, part dogged display. Watson continued on like this, switching from accepting blame to explaining why, given the weather and the cryptic RDF readings, anyone in his position would have done the same thing. “The condition of visibility, remember, was such that we were unable to get our true position from the stars. We were compelled to rely upon the radio station. I asked for our bearings repeatedly. From about 6:30 until 8 o’clock p.m., that most vital period in our lives, we were unable to get radio bearings from the station. I accept that responsibility. I made a naval officer’s decision. I was content the radio station was wrong. And that is why I gave the order.”', 'On September 22, Watson issued a similar statement to the court of inquiry and to the press: “The Squadron Commander hopes the responsibility for this disaster, which he considers entirely his own, may not descend upon the able and loyal subordinates who supported him on all occasions.” Watson was sacrificing himself, throwing himself into the prosecution’s line of fire. He also asked the court to waive its rule barring potential defendants from testifying—in effect, making himself more vulnerable to court-martial so that he could have his say now.', 'The court granted Watson’s request, and he was permitted to take the stand on September 24. “The responsibility was mine,” he said. “I was convinced that the station was wrong. But they were right.”', 'The court of inquiry’s president, Rear Admiral William V. Pratt, attempted to pick apart this blanket admission. “Do you feel,” he asked Watson, “that you can assume all of the responsibility that at times must fall on the shoulders of your division commanders?”', '“I have no desire to assume their responsibilities,” Watson replied. “I simply want to make clear that I assume all of my own.”', 'Watson braced himself for a public flogging. So perhaps he was as surprised as anyone when the opposite occurred. Almost overnight, the squadron commander transformed—in the eyes of the public, at least—from the incompetent scion of a naval legend to a paragon of selflessness and sacrifice. More than one newspaper editorial used the word “manliness” to describe what he’d done.', '“Capt. Watson has given a splendid example of the finest attributes of character overcoming the elemental instinct of self-preservation,” the Army and Navy Journal declared, while the San Diego Sun waxed on about Watson’s “heroic” soul. “He waits for no court martial. He relies not on lawyers. He seeks no avenue of evasion. He resorts to no subterfuge. Lest the blame rest on some innocent man, he takes upon himself full responsibility for his actions.”', 'Others around the country joined the chorus, taking Watson’s testimony as their cue to examine what true leadership really meant. “The heroism of captain Watson is of a different type,” declared the Santa Monica Evening Gazette. “It manifests itself after deliberation; after the weighing of consequences.” And this from the San Francisco Chronicle: “From the moment the ship struck, his bearing and speech have been that of a most remarkable example of real manliness under the most distressing conditions which an officer in his position can ever meet.”', 'The goodwill seemed to play a part in Watson persuading the other officers named as defendants to join him in testifying, so that they also would have the chance to recount what had happened that night. This was no small thing: By opening themselves to prosecution, these officers had to have faith that Watson’s contrition would reflect well on them. Admiral Pratt called their decision to testify “worthy of the best traditions of the Navy.”\xa0', 'When the Delphy’s skipper, Hunter, testified, he also made sure to blame the technology, as Watson had. “I’ll have to admit that it was an error in judgment,” he testified. “But as contributing causes I believe … the fact that a bilateral radio compass is used there were partly responsible.” Hunter also floated the “possibility” that “abnormal currents caused by the Japanese earthquake” contributed to the problem. In response, the lieutenant commander in charge of the Point Arguello lighthouse took the stand, defending his compass bearings that night. In fact, the readings had been within a few degrees of accuracy the whole time, even if one of them had required a reciprocal adjustment.', 'Many of Watson’s other commanders said that they weren’t responsible for what had happened because they’d been duty-bound to follow the Delphy’s lead. The Navy’s sacred adherence to chain of command suddenly was on trial, too. Robert Morris, the commander of the division of ships immediately astern of the Delphy, said that they “could not possibly be held culpable in carrying out the destroyer doctrine of following their leader.” Rear Admiral Pratt asked Morris, “Does seniority take the place of common sense?” Morris replied, “They are supposed to be synonymous.”', 'Not every skipper had hewed so tightly to that edict. Thomas A. Symington of the Thompson, the last ship in line, said that once he’d noticed the confusion of lights and sirens ahead, he slowed down to take soundings. Leslie Bratton of the Stoddert said that he’d opted to violate the no-navigation order and asked the lighthouse for radio bearings himself, then steered his ship away in time to avoid disaster. Hardy B. Page, navigator of the Hamilton, said that he’d suspected there was a problem ahead and advised his commanding officer to get word to the division commander—a decision that helped the division’s three ships escape intact.', 'Finally, the board heard from Walter Roper—the division commander who a few hours before the disaster had jousted with Watson by radio about helping the Cuba. Roper was as flinty on the stand as he’d been that night on the water. “I’m not a desk man. My experience comes from hard knocks,” he said, a jab at Watson’s lack of experience and Hunter’s academy training. “There are too many book-learned and not enough practical men running the Navy.” In Roper’s view, those on the Delphy should never have assumed that the ship really was going 20 knots in such choppy water. The error, he said, was in putting “too much reliance on computation of speed by propeller revolutions.” In his experience, he said, he’d seen propellers indicate 20 knots when the ship was in fact going only 12.', 'Roper made a point of saying that he would have heeded the lighthouse. “I have gone into the most dangerous harbors in the world through impenetrable fogs, guided almost wholly by radio compass,” he said. His division had never turned left, he testified, because he never came close to trusting the Delphy. “I was positive we had not passed Point Arguello. I did not know the forward ships were turning. Could I have seen them, I would not have followed, but instead would have tried to stop them. My motto is ‘Never try to turn a corner until you have passed.’\u202f”', 'Rear Admiral Pratt asked Roper if he would have turned left had he been on the ship behind the Delphy. “Of course I would not,” Roper said. “\u202f‘Follow the leader’ is all right, but it should be tempered with common sense. When I was a boy, our leader once jumped off a barn. I stayed put—and walked down to pick him up. He had a broken leg.” The room erupted with laughter.', 'But the fact remained that Roper failed to speak up against Watson at the time. Had he been stinging from their quarrel over the Cuba? If he’d said something—one of many ifs that night—might the entire disaster have been avoided, and 23 lives spared?', 'On October 12, the court of inquiry made its determination. Never mind the weather and the radio; the Honda Point disaster, the court ruled, was the result of “bad errors and faulty navigation.” Faced with so much uncertainty, the ships should have slowed down to take depth soundings. Following the leader may have been a Navy tradition, but it shouldn’t trump reason.', 'Eleven officers were recommended for court-martial. Watson, Hunter, and Blodgett were charged with “culpable inefficiency and negligence,” and eight others with simple negligence. But the court seemed gripped by contradictory impulses. It issued a letter to Calhoun, the Young’s commander, commending him “for coolness, intelligence, and seamanlike ability,” and to Walter D. Seed, of the Fuller, for “great bravery in swimming … about seventy five yards, through a rough and turbulent sea … for the salvage of the crew.” Yet both also faced charges of negligence.', 'The court-martial proceedings took place in rapid succession during the month of November. All eyes remained on Watson. Would his penitence spare the others? On November 7, Watson doubled down with another public statement. “I am ready and anxious to take my medicine. I don’t want an acquittal. For me to be acquitted by this court would be bad for the naval service, to which both my father and myself have devoted our lives.”', 'Calhoun, at his trial, went out of his way to commend Watson. He testified that in his opinion no power on earth could have saved the Young and the other ships after the Delphy ran aground. Calhoun insisted that he had no reason to suspect the Delphy of any errors, and testified that he and the Young’s crew would not have done anything differently had they been at the front of the line—except perhaps take soundings.', 'Watson reciprocated as a witness at Calhoun’s trial. “Every man of the crew of the Young owes his life solely and entirely to Commander Calhoun,” he testified.', 'In his summation speech in Watson’s trial, Watson’s lawyer, Thomas T. Craven, noted how, at Honda Point, “fate was indeed stern upon this occasion.” If the Delphy had continued south for just a few more minutes before turning, the entire column of ships would have cleared the rocks. If they’d turned a few minutes sooner, the coast would have been more forgiving, resulting in less damage and fewer lives lost. How many Navy men, Craven asked, had made similarly small missteps and escaped the hand of fate? Watson, he suggested, was a victim of bad luck.', 'Calhoun was acquitted after 40 minutes of deliberation. Blodgett, the Delphy’s navigator, was also acquitted, as were seven other defendants. There were just two convictions:\xa0Edward Howe Watson and Donald T. Hunter would not escape official blame for what happened that night. But considering the scale of the catastrophe, their sentences were lighter than expected. Both Watson and Hunter were allowed to continue their military careers, but with lower ranking numbers, which virtually eliminated the possibility of promotion. Neither would command a ship again, but they would retain their ranks. And the careers of the other men would be saved.', '“It is a very proper sentence,” Watson told reporters. “It is a fitting punishment. The loss of a few numbers could not be a sufficient punishment for an error as great as mine was. I am glad that the sentence is as severe as it is. It puts me very near the bottom of the list of captains, I guess. Needless to say, it does not make me happy.”', 'Watson had transformed from a villain to a hero with his admission in September. Now, in December, with his career intact, things changed again. Back Watson went, from hero to goat. Yet, by taking the blame, had Watson—no matter how gallant the gesture—simply given the Navy a smooth path toward putting the embarrassing episode behind it? And was the Navy now rewarding Watson for his contrition? After the loss of seven ships and 23 lives, how was it exactly that not one member of the Navy had lost their job?', '“Just learned court-martial has been very lenient with everybody,” President Calvin Coolidge said. Navy Secretary Denby also made sure to grumble publicly that the “sentence in [Watson’s] case is inadequate.”', 'On December 29, the Army and Navy Journal reported, “The light sentence created almost as great a sensation at Washington as the disaster.”', 'Eugene Dooman’s escape from the scene at Honda Point occurred just before dawn after the wrecks, when a train to Los Angeles approached the local station where the relief efforts were headquartered. Watson told Dooman and a few others to board it. Hundreds of other men would be taking the San Diego train a few hours later. Dooman, like many in the squadron, was covered from head to foot with oil, so a conductor placed some newspapers on the seat, and off they went. In Los Angeles, Dooman was on his own again, delivered from the tragedy—and from the official narrative.', 'The available record from the court of inquiry and Watson’s court-martial includes just one mention of a civilian on the Delphy, but Dooman’s name never appears. In the years to come, as military and civilian historians researched the Honda Point disaster, the idea of a not-spoken-for witness to the disaster proved tantalizing. He was called the “mystery guest,” the “civilian,” the “phantom passenger.” Rumors circulated that he and Watson had been drinking that day (Watson and others denied this), or that Watson subsequently swore him to silence about what really went wrong that night. But while Dooman’s identity was never well publicized, it was never really secret either. In January 1924, he gave a long interview to an English-language paper in Japan, complimenting Watson’s performance on the night of the wreck and relating the tale of his own escape. Had the historians and writers seen that article, the mystery would have been solved.', 'After 30 years as a diplomat in Tokyo, Dooman came home to America after Pearl Harbor, retiring just a few years later, in 1945. It took until the 1960s for him to be located and asked about Honda Point. “I am not competent” to pass judgment on Watson’s decisions that day, he wrote one interlocutor in 1966. “That is to say, I cannot weigh the extenuating circumstances, but a disaster did occur and the man who made the decision had to assume responsibility.”', 'Dooman was asked why he was never called to testify in the inquiry, and what happened to the $3,000 in silver he’d brought on board. The answers, it turned out, were linked. The silver was sacrificed, Dooman wrote, in the name of discretion. The money had been found in the wreckage, he wrote, “but could not be claimed without the probability of being called as a witness in the court-martial, and Watson and his defense officer were afraid that my testimony might prove harmful to Watson, since I was with him when the ship struck.” By today’s standards, these actions would have constituted a cover-up. But every answer Dooman gave seemed to prompt more questions. Why had the Navy not asked him to testify? Did his job in the State Department play a part in that decision? Or was the Navy afraid that additional testimony from a civilian passenger would add yet more unwelcome intrigue to a debacle it wished would just go away?', 'Dooman wouldn’t say. But he and Watson remained friends for years. A few days after the disaster, Dooman explained, with the inquiry not yet begun, he’d paid a visit to Watson and his wife at their home in San Diego. (Some armchair historians, parsing the disaster’s themes of negligence and culpability, have gone so far as to wonder if the captain reimbursed Dooman his lost $3,000 in return for his discretion. If such a thing occurred, Dooman never mentioned it.) The Watsons would later visit Japan, in 1937, and dine with Dooman there. He curtly alluded to the price Watson paid for the tragedy, the toll it took on him. “After the disaster,” Dooman wrote, “he lost his zest for living and became very despondent.”', 'Just after the court-martial, Dooman wrote a letter to Watson, one of dozens sent by friends and well-wishers hoping to soften the blow. “Do you know what a splendid impression you have made on everybody,” the diplomat wrote from Washington, “not only those high in the Navy but the man in the street? I dined with Admiral Knight who said splendid things about you. I think you will appreciate even more, though, what I overheard in the cars the other day—‘Well,’ said one, ‘I don’t get this stuff about the compass, but as long as we have fellows in the Navy like this guy who took the blame we shouldn’t worry.’\u202f”', 'William Calhoun was cleared of any blame for the Young’s tragedy; he was even commended for his cool demeanor during the rescue. But the loss of 20 men weighed heavily on him, and for a time it seemed foolish to assume that Calhoun would command a ship again. Eventually, however, his career righted itself. After serving on several ships, further instruction at the Naval War College, and a stint as an instructor at the Naval Academy, Calhoun returned to sea as commanding officer of the USS Rochester, and later the USS California. In 1938, he was promoted to rear admiral. The next year, he became commander of the Navy’s Pacific base in Honolulu and remained in that position through World War II. “There was nothing the fleet wanted that Uncle Bill wouldn’t get,” one commander would say.', 'Calhoun retired in 1946 a four-star admiral, after 44 years of active service. There was just one thing missing from his time at sea: He never saw battle. For that he’d be granted some satisfaction from the author James A. Michener, who’d been a lieutenant commander under Calhoun during the war. “Those of us who worked for Uncle Billy believed that he had played a major role in smothering the Japanese with matériel,” Michener wrote in his memoirs, “and the fighting admirals agreed.” In Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific—the Pulitzer Prize–winning basis for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical—Calhoun is said to be the model for Millard Kester, a grounded admiral who finally gets to do battle at sea, leading an entire invasion force. And winning.', 'Calhoun died in 1963; he had married and was a grandfather many times over. In 1984, some 61 years after the disaster, a scuba diver and amateur treasure hunter exploring the California coast noticed something shiny on the ocean floor, churned up by a recent storm: a class ring from the Naval Academy. It didn’t take long to connect the ring to its deceased owner. The diver had hoped to make some money for a discovery from the site of the disaster. One collector offered him $1,500. Then a fellow diver let him know that Calhoun’s widow, Rosalie, was alive and living in Coronado, near San Diego. Her phone number was listed. He agreed to sell the ring to her for $400—the cost of the dive, he said.', 'Rosalie had never remarried. The ring, when the diver handed it over, stirred something in her. “It’s like part of him was brought back,” she said, filled with emotion for her lost husband.', 'On December 14, 1923, six days after Edward Howe Watson’s conviction in a Navy court-martial, his father, retired admiral John Crittenden Watson, died at 81. A fellow retired admiral, Colby M. Chester, wrote to the younger Watson that same day: “Your name was the last one uttered by your father, and I know how happy the Honda affair made him.” Happy that\xa0his son’s career was intact, perhaps. Or that the family name had, despite everything, retained some of its dignity.\xa0', 'On January 10, 1924, Watson along with his wife and daughter moved to Honolulu, where he was stationed until his retirement five years later. In the 1930s, the Watsons lived in New York and then in Jamestown, Rhode Island, visiting Japan several times. In the years before World War II, Watson indulged his fascination with Japan, writing poems about historic Japanese figures. That other existence he might have led before Honda Point—the life of a sly and insightful Navy attaché, drawing out spies and supplying Washington with essential information about a potentially lethal foe—seemed to loom large for him.', 'In the late 1930s, Watson drafted a long policy memo about Japan to a friend at the Naval War College, still hoping someone would heed his warnings—“stuff that I have worked up during the past 5 years, since my retirement,” as he described it. “Perhaps it will help to save many hours to some fellow who is doing a bit of research work on the subject. Dispose of it as your judgment dictates. Either in the files or by burning.”', 'Watson died of heart disease in a Navy hospital on January 7, 1942, a month to the day after Pearl Harbor proved his point. His family later said that they thought the attack had hastened his death. Honda Point was not mentioned in any of his published obituaries.', 'Watson had pursued a life of significance, of honor. At Honda Point, the son emulated the father, following the traditions of leadership codified by an entire generation—and those same traditions contributed to the disaster. But after the worst happened, and the nation had judged him, he chose to preserve his character. In doing so, he acquired a different kind of significance, one he hadn’t expected.', 'In his papers, there is a letter from Watson’s father written on October 1, 1923, just after Watson had publicly accepted responsibility for the error that cost the Navy seven ships and 23 lives. In its tone, the letter was far warmer and more effusive than the one that had preceded it. “I cannot express in any words how proud we are of you and of your devoted wife,” the father wrote.', 'In the letter, Watson’s father offered his son a gift. He said that a relative of the late Admiral David Farragut had written to him “to express his confidence in you,” and sent along a precious keepsake: a makeshift tourniquet the elder Watson had made aboard the Hartford during the Civil War, “just as we were about to pass up the Mississippi by the Confederate batteries.”', 'Farragut had given this rag—a relic of John Crittenden’s most glorious moment in the Navy—to his own son “to use in case of a wound.” Now it seemed that someone else had a better use for it. “When I wrote him I know you would love to have it, he sent it to me,” Watson’s father wrote. “I will hold it for you until you come East. All of us join in ever much love to all three of you.”', 'And so Edward Howe Watson was offered a tourniquet—a message from father to son. His son was wounded and needed care. His son was worthy of greatness. His son was a Watson. And in court his son had not shirked from his duty to do what the father never had to do: go down with his ship.', '© 2023 The Atavist Magazine.

This time it placed them well north of the channel entrance. Watson, summoned to the bridge after dining with Dooman, couldn’t believe it. How could they have traveled all day and still be so far from the channel?', 'The more Watson thought it over, the less he trusted RDF. They were again faced with a choice: trust the new technology, or trust dead reckoning. And once again, they had a solution available to them that made sense of the confusing information they’d received: the reciprocal compass reading. When they flipped the RDF compass point, yet again the Delphy was where dead reckoning placed it. Problem solved, it seemed.', 'The Delphy’s navigator, Blodgett, knew that there was another tool they could use to make sure the ship had reached the channel: a fathometer, which measures depth. A shallow reading would mean the Delphy was too close to the coast to safely turn. Blodgett wanted to do a depth sounding. Hunter said it wasn’t necessary. And of course, to do a sounding they’d have to slow down.', 'Watson affirmed Hunter’s conclusion. He agreed that they had passed Point Arguello. This meant that the clock was ticking: To wait any longer would risk the ship hitting the far side of the channel, repeating the Cuba’s mistake. And so at 8:45 p.m., the Delphy laid plans for a 55-degree course change to port—a left turn, straight into the channel. Watson returned to his quarters.', 'From the bridge, Hunter could see the lights of ten or more ships behind him in the dark. Maybe visibility wasn’t so bad after all? But then, just after the turn, the\xa0Delphy plunged once again into a thick fog bank. The men on board couldn’t see a thing.', 'Two boats behind the Delphy on the Young, William Calhoun still couldn’t make out the lights from Point Arguello. Perhaps the fog was too thick, or the Young too far from shore? But he did see the lights of the Delphy and the S.P. Lee, just ahead, and some of the other ships behind. So he continued to follow the leader.', 'Then came a jolt to the ship—not so much heard as felt, a slight trembling in the hull. At once, Calhoun thought they’d been rammed, but by what? He rushed to the bridge just in time for a second jolt. There was nothing slight about this one. The Young’s navigator had lurched out of the formation—technically the correct reaction for a ship running aground—only to slam into something harder.', 'Right away the Young started to list, its engine room filling with water through a gash in the hull. It took just seconds for the entire destroyer to lean about 30 degrees. Then the power went out. Between the darkness and the fog, no one could see a thing. By the time Calhoun ordered his executive officer, Lieutenant Eugene Herzinger, to pass the word to stand by to abandon ship, the ship was listing nearly 45 degrees. This meant that the lifeboats were no longer an option—they were completely submerged.', 'Calhoun was left with one narrow hope: that the Young could somehow settle against whatever it was they’d rammed into and avoid sinking entirely.', 'He crawled up to the ship’s port side, which had now risen out of the water. The hull was coated in oil, and so slick that the crew that made it up there before him now had nothing to hang on to. Some had fallen into the water, and there seemed to be no way of helping them. To follow them in would doom them all.', 'And so Calhoun retracted his own order to stand by to abandon ship and told everyone around him to spread the word to gather on the port side, and above all not to jump into the water. “Don’t leave her—she is on the rocks!” Calhoun cried. “She can’t sink. Stick and you’ll be saved!”', 'On the Delphy, Dooman was with Watson in the captain’s quarters when a noise came from beneath the ship. That scrape of metal against rock was unmistakable. Even he, a civilian, knew that they had hit bottom.', 'Then came the crash. The ship lurched, sending both Dooman and Watson toppling and shattering the glass of the portholes. Dooman was thrown against the window at his back. Drawers jumped out of cabinets, papers flew, everything not nailed down was suddenly somewhere else. Without a word Watson dashed to the bridge, leaving Dooman alone.', 'The bridge was in chaos. As far as Watson and Hunter were concerned, there was only one possibility: They’d gone too far ahead, hitting the same spot that claimed the Cuba, San Miguel Island. They’d soon learn how wrong they were. But in that moment, Watson ordered two radio messages to the other ships: “keep clear to the westward” and “nine turn”—turn to port, where he thought the others could still get to the channel.', 'The collision with the rocks had sent the bow of the Delphy high into the air. Waves swung the ship around so that it was now astride the beach, braced against a series of rock outcroppings. Each new surge sent the vessel into spasms, quickly rupturing the hull. Down-the-line ships had followed the Delphy’s lead. The S.P. Lee swung around to the side of the shore and halted. The Young was next, lurching sideways and sinking; it smashed into the shore just moments before the Delphy and was almost gone. Watson could only guess what was in store for the other ships—maybe the rocky shore would claim them all.', 'There was a more immediate concern, however. The waves  slamming the Delphy repeatedly into the rocks had caused the fuel tanks to rupture. Hunter knew that the oil burners were still operational, making a boiler explosion all but imminent. He shut the master fuel valve from the bridge and ordered all crew in the engine room and the steaming fire rooms to lift the safety valves before coming up. By then the ship was pounding the rocks so violently that Hunter knew it was only a matter of time before it broke up and sank.', 'That was when Hunter asked Watson for permission to give the abandon ship order. Watson was quick to agree. But abandon for what? Oil from the Delphy was gushing into the surrounding water. The sea was a thick stew, with a five-inch slick on the surface, making swimming near impossible.', 'Back in Watson’s quarters, Dooman could hear the ship’s siren. He ran out on deck in time to see the Delphy’s searchlight beaming the water. He saw another ship crash, then another. He heard sirens and saw searchlights from those, too—ship after ship—and knew there had to be more behind them.', 'With men rushing everywhere and sirens wailing, a thought gripped Dooman: the silver. He stopped an officer, who told him that the lower part of the Delphy had flooded; this included the guest cabin where Dooman was staying. In any case, the silver was too heavy to carry if he needed to swim to safety. Dooman hurried back to Watson’s cabin. He sat down and waited, unsure of what to do next, or if he’d been forgotten completely.', 'The men on the top deck with Hunter were desperate to get off the ship. Some of the crew had braved the sludgy water and made it to an outcropping about 15 feet from shore; others became mired in the water, only to be pulled back onto the Delphy. Blodgett worked to set up a rope the men could use as a guide to the outcropping. Not everyone made it: Fireman Third Class James W. H. Conway and Cabin Cook Sofronio Dalida both died in the water.', 'Worst of all was the slow-motion tragedy of Fireman J. T. Pearson, who leapt overboard to help save three men in the water, shattered his glasses, and was blinded by the shards. Pearson cried for help and was pulled back aboard the Delphy. He was hysterical with pain and panic, and had taken in so much seawater and fuel that he fell to the deck. Blodgett held a flashlight as a pharmacist’s mate worked to remove the glass from Pearson’s eyes, to no avail. The ship was slick with oil, and equipment was flying everywhere, making it impossible to get Pearson onto a raft without endangering more lives.', 'Left with no other choice, Blodgett ordered a radioman to lash Pearson to the Delphy’s searchlight tower—what appeared to be a safe place amidships, forward of where the waves were breaking over the hull. They used a signal line that was tight enough to secure him, but not so tight that he couldn’t free himself if he regained his faculties.', 'The plan was to come back and evacuate him; that never happened. The waves raged into the night as, from the shore, the men of the Delphy could hear his repeated screams.', 'Calhoun didn’t know how long he had before the Young  would sink. The ship had tilted fully onto its side in practically no time at all; Calhoun later put it at just 90 seconds from the moment they ran aground. Now his ship was sliced open on the starboard side, with just two feet of the port side still above the surface of the water.', 'With the port side now the Young’s deck, some 80 men gripped the smashed portholes of the ship’s hull. Many were barefoot and wore what they’d gone to sleep in; some were tied to one another with lines. They waited for rescue as the waves crashed against the ship.', 'Calhoun knew that he hadn’t time for his men to put on life preservers and file into lifeboats: Like Hunter on the Delphy, he was aware that the active burners could explode the boiler, igniting the oil in the water around them. He asked for a volunteer to extinguish the burners. Fireman I.T. Scott came forward, then rushed below.', 'Minutes passed and Scott didn’t return. Had he cut the boiler? Did he escape the ship? Calhoun had no way to know for sure.', 'Calhoun’s executive officer, Gene Herzinger, and Chief Boatswain’s Mate Arthur Peterson climbed up and out from a bridge window. Peterson found an axe and smashed the portholes, providing the crew with handholds as the sea inundated the deck. They were 100 yards from shore, too far to risk swimming amid the oily waves and jagged rocks.', 'Or was it? Peterson wanted to try. He grabbed a life preserver and some rope and volunteered to swim for a large rock nearby. If he could reach that spot with the line, the other men could use it to get there, too, and they’d be that much closer to shore.', 'They were working through a plan when the Chauncey came into view. Calhoun nearly panicked. All it would take was one strong wake to shove the Young off its perch on the rock. The Chauncey got close enough to hear the Young’s crew—Calhoun loudest of them all—shouting not to collide with their sinking ship.', 'The Delphy’s lights went out. Alone in Watson’s quarters, Dooman couldn’t see a thing. He’d have no choice but to abandon the valise. Dooman returned to the deck, frightened but also appalled to have been forgotten.', 'The ship was low in the sea, and water swamped the deck. Dooman saw some of the crew at the stern, which appeared to be angled higher than the rest of the ship. Higher seemed safer, so he made his way in that direction, pulling himself along by the torpedo rails as waves smashed the deck. When Dooman arrived at the back of the Delphy, he saw that the men had run a line between the ship and a large rock 40 feet from shore. He also saw how dangerous it was—some who’d attempted the crossing had been flung into the water—and he was afraid to risk his life.', 'Dooman decided to run back to the front of the ship, until an officer shined a flashlight in his face. “You’re the passenger,” the officer said. It seemed that Dooman hadn’t been forgotten after all. He asked the man for help, and with the help of another sailor they found a raft stored on deck. They threw it over the side and jumped in, only to realize that it remained lashed to the Delphy. They were stuck. The ship slammed into the tiny craft, threatening to crash on top of them.', 'Dooman had a small penknife attached to his watch chain. He handed it to the sailor, who hacked through the line. With some effort, the raft made it over the waves to the rock. From there they were able to walk to land when the tide receded. One by one, Dooman and the others reached safety.', 'Watson finally made it across the line at 11 p.m. With one exception—Lieutenant Pearson, blinded and lashed to the rigging of a capsized, disintegrating vessel—the captain was the last to leave his ship.', 'The Chauncey threw all its power into reverse, but it was stuck with competing mandates—to avoid a collision with the Young, and to avoid the cliffs of Honda Point. In the end it hit the Young: The undertow hurled the Chauncey’s stern up against the destroyer’s port propeller blades, which ripped into the Chauncey’s starboard hull.', 'Water gushed into the engine room, the ship lost power, and, in a final insult, a wave slammed the Chauncey onto a reef. Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Booth sent down an order to stand by to abandon ship and, like Hunter and Calhoun before him, began weighing strategies to get his crew to shore alive. Perversely, the collision was good news for the Young. Once the Chauncey was firmly stuck on the same reef, it shielded Calhoun’s ship from some of the most turbulent waves.', 'Better still, the Chauncey was fairly close to shore—about 25 yards—and was no longer at risk of sinking. Now all the crew of the Young needed to do was get to the Chauncey, which was about 75 yards away. Members of the Chauncey’s crew succeeded in dragging a pair of lines ashore and setting up as many rafts to ferry the men through the oily waves.', 'Once ashore, the survivors climbed a steep cliff to reach the mainland. A radioman on the Chauncey named Frederick Fish later remembered finding an unconscious crew member of the Young in the water and bringing him to land.\xa0Men from the Delphy were there as well, Fish recalled—“walking about in a dreamlike daze, stumbling and falling, cutting their hands and bare feet on the jagged edges of the cliff.”', 'Looking out at the water, Fish could see the Delphy smashed against a rock and observed its crew shuttle as many men to shore as possible. Before long, Fish heard “the cries for help of an injured man who was lashed there.” That was Pearson. Blodgett from the Delphy was on shore, and he told Fish what had happened—how Pearson was blinded and strapped to the hull of the Delphy. “His calls kept up through the night, and they still ring in my brain,” Fish recalled. “To hear a fellow creature calling for help and not be able to relieve him is the crudest torture possible to man.”', 'On the Young, holding fast to its sinking hull, all the remaining men could do was look on as the crew of the Chauncey worked to save themselves before setting up a line for the other ship. Finally, someone decided not to wait any longer. Peterson, the chief boatswain’s mate, had planned to swim for the rock between the Young and the shore before the Chauncey arrived. Now he was ready to swim to the Chauncey.', 'Peterson took three lengths of line totaling more than 100 yards, found a doughnut-shaped buoy, fastened the line to it, and slipped the buoy over his head. On Calhoun’s order, he dove into the frigid water and made it to the Chauncey in a matter of minutes. A crew member recalled hearing Calhoun shout that a swimmer was coming their way. Once Peterson had been lifted aboard the Chauncey, Herzinger followed using Peterson’s line. “Had he lost his hold,” Calhoun recalled, “he would have been in fuel oil and an angry sea, and would undoubtedly have lost his life.”', 'After Herzinger made it across, the Chauncey sent back a seven-man raft. Evacuations commenced—four men on the first raft, eight on the second, ten on the others. It took 11 crossings to get everyone who could be found off the Young. Calhoun made one last inspection before boarding the final raft. “I want to state that Providence put the Chauncey ashore in that place,” Calhoun later said. “It is absolutely certain in my mind that the loss of the Chauncey saved half of the crew of my ship or more.”', 'There was one additional consolation: Fireman Scott, who had volunteered to shut down the Young’s boiler, finally reappeared at about 10:30 p.m., when the lighthouse keepers on shore heard cries for help from the bottom of the bluffs—five surviving sailors, including Scott. He’d made it off the Young and into the water but was unconscious, and when he awoke he clung to a piece of flotsam; he’d floated for an hour before being hauled aboard a raft.', 'Calhoun knew that not everyone from his ship had made it. He wondered how many still flailed in the oil-coated water. And the engine- and fire-room crews deep inside the ship: had they been trapped down below, or were they pulled out by the undertow as the ship rolled? Those men—his men—had been 150 yards from shore with no way out of the ship.', 'On shore, when Herzinger mentioned to Calhoun that the losses were great, as many as 20 or 30 sailors, the young captain’s response was grave: “My God, I know—but we will not discuss it now.”', 'The rescue efforts were just getting underway as the remaining ships neared Honda Point, still following the leader. For some it was too late to change course. One after another, they smashed into the shore—a seven-ship pileup on the California coast—hitting rocks, reefs, and, in some cases, one another.', 'The officers of the Woodbury saw lights ahead of the other ships and assumed a man was overboard. They reversed engines, but not soon enough to avoid ramming a large boulder.', 'The Nicholas struck a reef, and the pounding surf spun the boat until it pointed out to sea. The oil, the rocks, and the darkness made lowering rafts impossible; the men had to wait all night for a lifeline from shore.', 'Then came the Farragut, named for the great Civil War hero. Lieutenant Commander J. F. McClain ordered a full stop, but reversing the engines doused the ship’s lights. Suddenly, it was dark again, and the Fuller, next in the squadron line, collided with the Farragut before hitting a pinnacle rock—the same one that had claimed the Woodbury.', 'The ships at the back of Watson’s column, the Percival and the Somers, had time and space enough to change course. The last division—the Paul Hamilton, the Stoddert, and the Thompson—never took the turn into the channel.', 'Along the shore, an entire community was mobilizing to help rescue the sailors still in the water. The ships’ sirens had woken nearby residents, who loaded their cars with blankets, hot coffee, and food, and rushed to the steep bluff. A fishing captain, Giacomo Noceti, bravely ferried his boat to the edge of the rocks and retrieved some 150 men with lines. A nearby rail station became a headquarters for relief workers, who brought aid in and shipped rescued sailors out. A passing train took the injured to Santa Barbara hospitals, and later that day another transported 38 officers and 517 enlisted men to the naval base in San Diego.', 'The Delphy snapped in two just five minutes after everyone except Pearson had evacuated. The ship’s searchlight tower leaned farther over with each barrage of waves, until it dragged the rest of the ship over and down. The section of the deck where Pearson had been tied up was pulled into the ocean. He was one of the Delphy’s three casualties that night.', 'How many were lost from the rest of the fleet wouldn’t be known for hours. Through it all, Watson checked on the injured, organized search parties, tallied his men, and reported back to naval headquarters. By morning, he was preparing to send salvage parties back to the ships and arranging for the care of survivors. Even Calhoun, grappling with unspeakable losses, would later praise the commander, stating, “I only hope that if ever I am faced with the tragedy that faced him that night, I’ll be half the man that he was: cool, calm, courageous, and thoughtful; never missing an opportunity to aid.” But in idle moments, alone with his thoughts, Watson seemed to Dooman years older.', 'When a search party returned with the body of Fireman Conway, who had fallen from a rescue line into the water, Watson approached the stretcher. He raised the blanket and looked down on Conway for a long moment. Then, silently, the captain unbuckled the sword he wore and laid it beside the body.', 'Was he thinking about all the men—some 300 or so, as he estimated early on—who might be dead because of the decision he’d signed off on?', 'Was he thinking about his friend Dooman, there only because of his invitation? Or his daughter, who’d been promised a spot, and how lucky it was she hadn’t been aboard?', 'Was he thinking about his wider family? His father and the legacy of the Watsons, that night on the Hartford in 1864 and Captain Farragut’s cry of “Damn the torpedoes!”? Did he sense any connection between that historic moment and his decision to push forward at all costs?', 'There would be time for him to mull these questions—to sift through everything that had happened—later on that night, in the weeks and months to come, and for the rest of his life.', '3.', 'In the space of just ten minutes, the Navy lost more ships than it had during all of World War I. Seven destroyers ran aground, one after another, each with more than 100 men aboard. Some of them split in two on the rocks. They collided with one another. They hemorrhaged oil—some 300,000 gallons covering 800 acres.', 'Twenty-three sailors lost their lives: three on the Delphy, twenty on the Young. A miracle by some measures, a debacle by others. Of the men trapped inside the Young, most probably fought through smoke and gas, darkness and freezing water. None made it to shore. Those who didn’t drown immediately were caught in the ebbing tide and sucked out to sea.', 'The disaster was front-page news around the country. Some 10,000 people turned up for a memorial service in San Diego. A week later, hundreds of visitors from Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, and other nearby towns flocked to the cliffs above Honda Point to view the wreckage. Demand to visit the scene was so high that a special train was provided on Sunday. Many packed a lunch and remained on the bluffs all day.', 'The day after the disaster, Navy secretary Edwin Denby seized on the great Kanto earthquake as the explanation. It was because of the quake, he suggested—an act of God, with unthinkable ramifications an ocean away—that nothing went as planned on the water that day. It explained why the ships never really reached 20 knots. Usually, the current pushed ships south; on that day it pushed them north. “One of the destroyers was broken in two, and it seems as if she was carried bodily up and dropped,” Denby marveled.', 'Others blamed technology: that infuriating RDF, sending good sailors astray, undermining their expertise. “The theory was advanced by mariners,” The Washington Post reported, “that the compass bearings taken from a nearby shore station as guidance through the fog, had been transmitted erroneously.”', 'Yet to some the weather and the obscure compass readings only explained so much. The Navy scheduled an inquiry for Monday, September 17. Depending on the outcome, the next step could involve court-martials. That left a week for the press to point fingers. “There has been a peculiar reluctance on the part of officers responsible for full and prompt reports of what happened,” a New York Times editorial declared. “For the honor of the United States Navy and for the good of the service those who were responsible should be made to suffer for it.”', 'Among those who might bear responsibility, Watson was an ideal target. Not only had he been the one in charge, but he offered a newspaper-ready narrative: an admiral’s son, wealthy and connected, now facing utter disgrace. Watson and the ship commanders hunkered in San Diego, awaiting the inquiry in silence. Those close to Watson encouraged him to try and stop what was coming. His brother Loyall urged him to stand firm and defend himself. His brother-in-law, Clifford Gratz, wanted to leverage his family’s relationship with the Rockefellers to spare Watson and help stave off any embarrassment to the family. Naval Academy friends worked back channels, pleading for leniency.\xa0', 'But there was one person whose opinion mattered more than any other. On September 16, retired rear admiral John Crittenden Watson, then 80 and in fragile health, wrote to his son from his home in Washington, D.C. “I knew the saving of all the lives possible would be the greatest comfort to you and our dear Hermine,” the elder Watson wrote. “Like both of you, our thought is that you were able to save not only your own life but to assist others.”', 'With its measured tone, the admiral’s letter spoke volumes. There was no assurance of his son’s guiltlessness—no proclamation that, faced with the day’s beguiling circumstances, he would have acted the same. The message was clear: A man’s fate mattered less than his reputation. The family’s honor rested with Watson now.', 'Typically, Navy inquiries are confidential, as with a grand jury in a criminal case. But the press demanded that they be allowed to watch, and Denby relented. As the inquiry got underway, its public nature seemed more than anything to dictate what would become of Watson and his commanders. No one wished to give any impression that mercy would be shown to the men behind the worst peacetime disaster in Navy history.', 'Watson and his commanders wouldn’t be allowed to testify; as they were possible defendants in court-martial proceedings, anything they said could expose them to prosecution. Only one senior crew member of the Delphy was called to testify: Laurence Blodgett, Hunter’s second-in-command. “We were satisfied that the Arguello radio station was wrong,” Blodgett explained from the stand. “They kept giving our position north and to the west of Point Arguello, and when we could not make this check with our figures, we finally took the reciprocal of their bearings, which would show us already in the Santa Barbara Channel.” As soon as he finished, the prosecutor asked to add Blodgett to the defendant list too. His role in making navigation decisions transformed him, in the eyes of the court, from a bystander to a suspect. Off the stand he went; the defense never had a chance to cross-examine him.', 'This was a search for scapegoats—but should the ships’ commanders have expected anything different? Watson at least was desperate to have his say. Just days after the worst possible thing that could have happened on his watch came to pass, he was staring down what he considered another disaster. The men under his command—the ones who’d followed his lead—were about to lose their reputations and livelihoods. This could be why, on the inquiry’s second day, Watson made his first public comments about Honda Point. “The responsibility for the course of the destroyer squadron was mine, a responsibility which I fully realized,” he told a reporter for a news service, whose story would appear in papers around the country in the days to come. “But that decision was based upon 33 years of experience in the Navy, and made after due consideration of reports of our position from the Point Arguello radio station, which were confusing.”', 'It was part mea culpa, part dogged display. Watson continued on like this, switching from accepting blame to explaining why, given the weather and the cryptic RDF readings, anyone in his position would have done the same thing. “The condition of visibility, remember, was such that we were unable to get our true position from the stars. We were compelled to rely upon the radio station. I asked for our bearings repeatedly. From about 6:30 until 8 o’clock p.m., that most vital period in our lives, we were unable to get radio bearings from the station. I accept that responsibility. I made a naval officer’s decision. I was content the radio station was wrong. And that is why I gave the order.”', 'On September 22, Watson issued a similar statement to the court of inquiry and to the press: “The Squadron Commander hopes the responsibility for this disaster, which he considers entirely his own, may not descend upon the able and loyal subordinates who supported him on all occasions.” Watson was sacrificing himself, throwing himself into the prosecution’s line of fire. He also asked the court to waive its rule barring potential defendants from testifying—in effect, making himself more vulnerable to court-martial so that he could have his say now.', 'The court granted Watson’s request, and he was permitted to take the stand on September 24. “The responsibility was mine,” he said. “I was convinced that the station was wrong. But they were right.”', 'The court of inquiry’s president, Rear Admiral William V. Pratt, attempted to pick apart this blanket admission. “Do you feel,” he asked Watson, “that you can assume all of the responsibility that at times must fall on the shoulders of your division commanders?”', '“I have no desire to assume their responsibilities,” Watson replied. “I simply want to make clear that I assume all of my own.”', 'Watson braced himself for a public flogging. So perhaps he was as surprised as anyone when the opposite occurred. Almost overnight, the squadron commander transformed—in the eyes of the public, at least—from the incompetent scion of a naval legend to a paragon of selflessness and sacrifice. More than one newspaper editorial used the word “manliness” to describe what he’d done.', '“Capt. Watson has given a splendid example of the finest attributes of character overcoming the elemental instinct of self-preservation,” the Army and Navy Journal declared, while the San Diego Sun waxed on about Watson’s “heroic” soul. “He waits for no court martial. He relies not on lawyers. He seeks no avenue of evasion. He resorts to no subterfuge. Lest the blame rest on some innocent man, he takes upon himself full responsibility for his actions.”', 'Others around the country joined the chorus, taking Watson’s testimony as their cue to examine what true leadership really meant. “The heroism of captain Watson is of a different type,” declared the Santa Monica Evening Gazette. “It manifests itself after deliberation; after the weighing of consequences.” And this from the San Francisco Chronicle: “From the moment the ship struck, his bearing and speech have been that of a most remarkable example of real manliness under the most distressing conditions which an officer in his position can ever meet.”', 'The goodwill seemed to play a part in Watson persuading the other officers named as defendants to join him in testifying, so that they also would have the chance to recount what had happened that night. This was no small thing: By opening themselves to prosecution, these officers had to have faith that Watson’s contrition would reflect well on them. Admiral Pratt called their decision to testify “worthy of the best traditions of the Navy.”\xa0', 'When the Delphy’s skipper, Hunter, testified, he also made sure to blame the technology, as Watson had. “I’ll have to admit that it was an error in judgment,” he testified. “But as contributing causes I believe … the fact that a bilateral radio compass is used there were partly responsible.” Hunter also floated the “possibility” that “abnormal currents caused by the Japanese earthquake” contributed to the problem. In response, the lieutenant commander in charge of the Point Arguello lighthouse took the stand, defending his compass bearings that night. In fact, the readings had been within a few degrees of accuracy the whole time, even if one of them had required a reciprocal adjustment.', 'Many of Watson’s other commanders said that they weren’t responsible for what had happened because they’d been duty-bound to follow the Delphy’s lead. The Navy’s sacred adherence to chain of command suddenly was on trial, too. Robert Morris, the commander of the division of ships immediately astern of the Delphy, said that they “could not possibly be held culpable in carrying out the destroyer doctrine of following their leader.” Rear Admiral Pratt asked Morris, “Does seniority take the place of common sense?” Morris replied, “They are supposed to be synonymous.”', 'Not every skipper had hewed so tightly to that edict. Thomas A. Symington of the Thompson, the last ship in line, said that once he’d noticed the confusion of lights and sirens ahead, he slowed down to take soundings. Leslie Bratton of the Stoddert said that he’d opted to violate the no-navigation order and asked the lighthouse for radio bearings himself, then steered his ship away in time to avoid disaster. Hardy B. Page, navigator of the Hamilton, said that he’d suspected there was a problem ahead and advised his commanding officer to get word to the division commander—a decision that helped the division’s three ships escape intact.', 'Finally, the board heard from Walter Roper—the division commander who a few hours before the disaster had jousted with Watson by radio about helping the Cuba. Roper was as flinty on the stand as he’d been that night on the water. “I’m not a desk man. My experience comes from hard knocks,” he said, a jab at Watson’s lack of experience and Hunter’s academy training. “There are too many book-learned and not enough practical men running the Navy.” In Roper’s view, those on the Delphy should never have assumed that the ship really was going 20 knots in such choppy water. The error, he said, was in putting “too much reliance on computation of speed by propeller revolutions.” In his experience, he said, he’d seen propellers indicate 20 knots when the ship was in fact going only 12.', 'Roper made a point of saying that he would have heeded the lighthouse. “I have gone into the most dangerous harbors in the world through impenetrable fogs, guided almost wholly by radio compass,” he said. His division had never turned left, he testified, because he never came close to trusting the Delphy. “I was positive we had not passed Point Arguello. I did not know the forward ships were turning. Could I have seen them, I would not have followed, but instead would have tried to stop them. My motto is ‘Never try to turn a corner until you have passed.’\u202f”', 'Rear Admiral Pratt asked Roper if he would have turned left had he been on the ship behind the Delphy. “Of course I would not,” Roper said. “\u202f‘Follow the leader’ is all right, but it should be tempered with common sense. When I was a boy, our leader once jumped off a barn. I stayed put—and walked down to pick him up. He had a broken leg.” The room erupted with laughter.', 'But the fact remained that Roper failed to speak up against Watson at the time. Had he been stinging from their quarrel over the Cuba? If he’d said something—one of many ifs that night—might the entire disaster have been avoided, and 23 lives spared?', 'On October 12, the court of inquiry made its determination. Never mind the weather and the radio; the Honda Point disaster, the court ruled, was the result of “bad errors and faulty navigation.” Faced with so much uncertainty, the ships should have slowed down to take depth soundings. Following the leader may have been a Navy tradition, but it shouldn’t trump reason.', 'Eleven officers were recommended for court-martial. Watson, Hunter, and Blodgett were charged with “culpable inefficiency and negligence,” and eight others with simple negligence. But the court seemed gripped by contradictory impulses. It issued a letter to Calhoun, the Young’s commander, commending him “for coolness, intelligence, and seamanlike ability,” and to Walter D. Seed, of the Fuller, for “great bravery in swimming … about seventy five yards, through a rough and turbulent sea … for the salvage of the crew.” Yet both also faced charges of negligence.', 'The court-martial proceedings took place in rapid succession during the month of November. All eyes remained on Watson. Would his penitence spare the others? On November 7, Watson doubled down with another public statement. “I am ready and anxious to take my medicine. I don’t want an acquittal. For me to be acquitted by this court would be bad for the naval service, to which both my father and myself have devoted our lives.”', 'Calhoun, at his trial, went out of his way to commend Watson. He testified that in his opinion no power on earth could have saved the Young and the other ships after the Delphy ran aground. Calhoun insisted that he had no reason to suspect the Delphy of any errors, and testified that he and the Young’s crew would not have done anything differently had they been at the front of the line—except perhaps take soundings.', 'Watson reciprocated as a witness at Calhoun’s trial. “Every man of the crew of the Young owes his life solely and entirely to Commander Calhoun,” he testified.', 'In his summation speech in Watson’s trial, Watson’s lawyer, Thomas T. Craven, noted how, at Honda Point, “fate was indeed stern upon this occasion.” If the Delphy had continued south for just a few more minutes before turning, the entire column of ships would have cleared the rocks. If they’d turned a few minutes sooner, the coast would have been more forgiving, resulting in less damage and fewer lives lost. How many Navy men, Craven asked, had made similarly small missteps and escaped the hand of fate? Watson, he suggested, was a victim of bad luck.', 'Calhoun was acquitted after 40 minutes of deliberation. Blodgett, the Delphy’s navigator, was also acquitted, as were seven other defendants. There were just two convictions:\xa0Edward Howe Watson and Donald T. Hunter would not escape official blame for what happened that night. But considering the scale of the catastrophe, their sentences were lighter than expected. Both Watson and Hunter were allowed to continue their military careers, but with lower ranking numbers, which virtually eliminated the possibility of promotion. Neither would command a ship again, but they would retain their ranks. And the careers of the other men would be saved.', '“It is a very proper sentence,” Watson told reporters. “It is a fitting punishment. The loss of a few numbers could not be a sufficient punishment for an error as great as mine was. I am glad that the sentence is as severe as it is. It puts me very near the bottom of the list of captains, I guess. Needless to say, it does not make me happy.”', 'Watson had transformed from a villain to a hero with his admission in September. Now, in December, with his career intact, things changed again. Back Watson went, from hero to goat. Yet, by taking the blame, had Watson—no matter how gallant the gesture—simply given the Navy a smooth path toward putting the embarrassing episode behind it? And was the Navy now rewarding Watson for his contrition? After the loss of seven ships and 23 lives, how was it exactly that not one member of the Navy had lost their job?', '“Just learned court-martial has been very lenient with everybody,” President Calvin Coolidge said. Navy Secretary Denby also made sure to grumble publicly that the “sentence in [Watson’s] case is inadequate.”', 'On December 29, the Army and Navy Journal reported, “The light sentence created almost as great a sensation at Washington as the disaster.”', 'Eugene Dooman’s escape from the scene at Honda Point occurred just before dawn after the wrecks, when a train to Los Angeles approached the local station where the relief efforts were headquartered. Watson told Dooman and a few others to board it. Hundreds of other men would be taking the San Diego train a few hours later. Dooman, like many in the squadron, was covered from head to foot with oil, so a conductor placed some newspapers on the seat, and off they went. In Los Angeles, Dooman was on his own again, delivered from the tragedy—and from the official narrative.', 'The available record from the court of inquiry and Watson’s court-martial includes just one mention of a civilian on the Delphy, but Dooman’s name never appears. In the years to come, as military and civilian historians researched the Honda Point disaster, the idea of a not-spoken-for witness to the disaster proved tantalizing. He was called the “mystery guest,” the “civilian,” the “phantom passenger.” Rumors circulated that he and Watson had been drinking that day (Watson and others denied this), or that Watson subsequently swore him to silence about what really went wrong that night. But while Dooman’s identity was never well publicized, it was never really secret either. In January 1924, he gave a long interview to an English-language paper in Japan, complimenting Watson’s performance on the night of the wreck and relating the tale of his own escape. Had the historians and writers seen that article, the mystery would have been solved.', 'After 30 years as a diplomat in Tokyo, Dooman came home to America after Pearl Harbor, retiring just a few years later, in 1945. It took until the 1960s for him to be located and asked about Honda Point. “I am not competent” to pass judgment on Watson’s decisions that day, he wrote one interlocutor in 1966. “That is to say, I cannot weigh the extenuating circumstances, but a disaster did occur and the man who made the decision had to assume responsibility.”', 'Dooman was asked why he was never called to testify in the inquiry, and what happened to the $3,000 in silver he’d brought on board. The answers, it turned out, were linked. The silver was sacrificed, Dooman wrote, in the name of discretion. The money had been found in the wreckage, he wrote, “but could not be claimed without the probability of being called as a witness in the court-martial, and Watson and his defense officer were afraid that my testimony might prove harmful to Watson, since I was with him when the ship struck.” By today’s standards, these actions would have constituted a cover-up. But every answer Dooman gave seemed to prompt more questions. Why had the Navy not asked him to testify? Did his job in the State Department play a part in that decision? Or was the Navy afraid that additional testimony from a civilian passenger would add yet more unwelcome intrigue to a debacle it wished would just go away?', 'Dooman wouldn’t say. But he and Watson remained friends for years. A few days after the disaster, Dooman explained, with the inquiry not yet begun, he’d paid a visit to Watson and his wife at their home in San Diego. (Some armchair historians, parsing the disaster’s themes of negligence and culpability, have gone so far as to wonder if the captain reimbursed Dooman his lost $3,000 in return for his discretion. If such a thing occurred, Dooman never mentioned it.) The Watsons would later visit Japan, in 1937, and dine with Dooman there. He curtly alluded to the price Watson paid for the tragedy, the toll it took on him. “After the disaster,” Dooman wrote, “he lost his zest for living and became very despondent.”', 'Just after the court-martial, Dooman wrote a letter to Watson, one of dozens sent by friends and well-wishers hoping to soften the blow. “Do you know what a splendid impression you have made on everybody,” the diplomat wrote from Washington, “not only those high in the Navy but the man in the street? I dined with Admiral Knight who said splendid things about you. I think you will appreciate even more, though, what I overheard in the cars the other day—‘Well,’ said one, ‘I don’t get this stuff about the compass, but as long as we have fellows in the Navy like this guy who took the blame we shouldn’t worry.’\u202f”', 'William Calhoun was cleared of any blame for the Young’s tragedy; he was even commended for his cool demeanor during the rescue. But the loss of 20 men weighed heavily on him, and for a time it seemed foolish to assume that Calhoun would command a ship again. Eventually, however, his career righted itself. After serving on several ships, further instruction at the Naval War College, and a stint as an instructor at the Naval Academy, Calhoun returned to sea as commanding officer of the USS Rochester, and later the USS California. In 1938, he was promoted to rear admiral. The next year, he became commander of the Navy’s Pacific base in Honolulu and remained in that position through World War II. “There was nothing the fleet wanted that Uncle Bill wouldn’t get,” one commander would say.', 'Calhoun retired in 1946 a four-star admiral, after 44 years of active service. There was just one thing missing from his time at sea: He never saw battle. For that he’d be granted some satisfaction from the author James A. Michener, who’d been a lieutenant commander under Calhoun during the war. “Those of us who worked for Uncle Billy believed that he had played a major role in smothering the Japanese with matériel,” Michener wrote in his memoirs, “and the fighting admirals agreed.” In Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific—the Pulitzer Prize–winning basis for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical—Calhoun is said to be the model for Millard Kester, a grounded admiral who finally gets to do battle at sea, leading an entire invasion force. And winning.', 'Calhoun died in 1963; he had married and was a grandfather many times over. In 1984, some 61 years after the disaster, a scuba diver and amateur treasure hunter exploring the California coast noticed something shiny on the ocean floor, churned up by a recent storm: a class ring from the Naval Academy. It didn’t take long to connect the ring to its deceased owner. The diver had hoped to make some money for a discovery from the site of the disaster. One collector offered him $1,500. Then a fellow diver let him know that Calhoun’s widow, Rosalie, was alive and living in Coronado, near San Diego. Her phone number was listed. He agreed to sell the ring to her for $400—the cost of the dive, he said.', 'Rosalie had never remarried. The ring, when the diver handed it over, stirred something in her. “It’s like part of him was brought back,” she said, filled with emotion for her lost husband.', 'On December 14, 1923, six days after Edward Howe Watson’s conviction in a Navy court-martial, his father, retired admiral John Crittenden Watson, died at 81. A fellow retired admiral, Colby M. Chester, wrote to the younger Watson that same day: “Your name was the last one uttered by your father, and I know how happy the Honda affair made him.” Happy that\xa0his son’s career was intact, perhaps. Or that the family name had, despite everything, retained some of its dignity.\xa0', 'On January 10, 1924, Watson along with his wife and daughter moved to Honolulu, where he was stationed until his retirement five years later. In the 1930s, the Watsons lived in New York and then in Jamestown, Rhode Island, visiting Japan several times. In the years before World War II, Watson indulged his fascination with Japan, writing poems about historic Japanese figures. That other existence he might have led before Honda Point—the life of a sly and insightful Navy attaché, drawing out spies and supplying Washington with essential information about a potentially lethal foe—seemed to loom large for him.', 'In the late 1930s, Watson drafted a long policy memo about Japan to a friend at the Naval War College, still hoping someone would heed his warnings—“stuff that I have worked up during the past 5 years, since my retirement,” as he described it. “Perhaps it will help to save many hours to some fellow who is doing a bit of research work on the subject. Dispose of it as your judgment dictates. Either in the files or by burning.”', 'Watson died of heart disease in a Navy hospital on January 7, 1942, a month to the day after Pearl Harbor proved his point. His family later said that they thought the attack had hastened his death. Honda Point was not mentioned in any of his published obituaries.', 'Watson had pursued a life of significance, of honor. At Honda Point, the son emulated the father, following the traditions of leadership codified by an entire generation—and those same traditions contributed to the disaster. But after the worst happened, and the nation had judged him, he chose to preserve his character. In doing so, he acquired a different kind of significance, one he hadn’t expected.', 'In his papers, there is a letter from Watson’s father written on October 1, 1923, just after Watson had publicly accepted responsibility for the error that cost the Navy seven ships and 23 lives. In its tone, the letter was far warmer and more effusive than the one that had preceded it. “I cannot express in any words how proud we are of you and of your devoted wife,” the father wrote.', 'In the letter, Watson’s father offered his son a gift. He said that a relative of the late Admiral David Farragut had written to him “to express his confidence in you,” and sent along a precious keepsake: a makeshift tourniquet the elder Watson had made aboard the Hartford during the Civil War, “just as we were about to pass up the Mississippi by the Confederate batteries.”', 'Farragut had given this rag—a relic of John Crittenden’s most glorious moment in the Navy—to his own son “to use in case of a wound.” Now it seemed that someone else had a better use for it. “When I wrote him I know you would love to have it, he sent it to me,” Watson’s father wrote. “I will hold it for you until you come East. All of us join in ever much love to all three of you.”', 'And so Edward Howe Watson was offered a tourniquet—a message from father to son. His son was wounded and needed care. His son was worthy of greatness. His son was a Watson. And in court his son had not shirked from his duty to do what the father never had to do: go down with his ship.', '© 2023 The Atavist Magazine.

He ran out on deck in time to see the Delphy’s searchlight beaming the water. He saw another ship crash, then another. He heard sirens and saw searchlights from those, too—ship after ship—and knew there had to be more behind them.', 'With men rushing everywhere and sirens wailing, a thought gripped Dooman: the silver. He stopped an officer, who told him that the lower part of the Delphy had flooded; this included the guest cabin where Dooman was staying. In any case, the silver was too heavy to carry if he needed to swim to safety. Dooman hurried back to Watson’s cabin. He sat down and waited, unsure of what to do next, or if he’d been forgotten completely.', 'The men on the top deck with Hunter were desperate to get off the ship. Some of the crew had braved the sludgy water and made it to an outcropping about 15 feet from shore; others became mired in the water, only to be pulled back onto the Delphy. Blodgett worked to set up a rope the men could use as a guide to the outcropping. Not everyone made it: Fireman Third Class James W. H. Conway and Cabin Cook Sofronio Dalida both died in the water.', 'Worst of all was the slow-motion tragedy of Fireman J. T. Pearson, who leapt overboard to help save three men in the water, shattered his glasses, and was blinded by the shards. Pearson cried for help and was pulled back aboard the Delphy. He was hysterical with pain and panic, and had taken in so much seawater and fuel that he fell to the deck. Blodgett held a flashlight as a pharmacist’s mate worked to remove the glass from Pearson’s eyes, to no avail. The ship was slick with oil, and equipment was flying everywhere, making it impossible to get Pearson onto a raft without endangering more lives.', 'Left with no other choice, Blodgett ordered a radioman to lash Pearson to the Delphy’s searchlight tower—what appeared to be a safe place amidships, forward of where the waves were breaking over the hull. They used a signal line that was tight enough to secure him, but not so tight that he couldn’t free himself if he regained his faculties.', 'The plan was to come back and evacuate him; that never happened. The waves raged into the night as, from the shore, the men of the Delphy could hear his repeated screams.', 'Calhoun didn’t know how long he had before the Young  would sink. The ship had tilted fully onto its side in practically no time at all; Calhoun later put it at just 90 seconds from the moment they ran aground. Now his ship was sliced open on the starboard side, with just two feet of the port side still above the surface of the water.', 'With the port side now the Young’s deck, some 80 men gripped the smashed portholes of the ship’s hull. Many were barefoot and wore what they’d gone to sleep in; some were tied to one another with lines. They waited for rescue as the waves crashed against the ship.', 'Calhoun knew that he hadn’t time for his men to put on life preservers and file into lifeboats: Like Hunter on the Delphy, he was aware that the active burners could explode the boiler, igniting the oil in the water around them. He asked for a volunteer to extinguish the burners. Fireman I.T. Scott came forward, then rushed below.', 'Minutes passed and Scott didn’t return. Had he cut the boiler? Did he escape the ship? Calhoun had no way to know for sure.', 'Calhoun’s executive officer, Gene Herzinger, and Chief Boatswain’s Mate Arthur Peterson climbed up and out from a bridge window. Peterson found an axe and smashed the portholes, providing the crew with handholds as the sea inundated the deck. They were 100 yards from shore, too far to risk swimming amid the oily waves and jagged rocks.', 'Or was it? Peterson wanted to try. He grabbed a life preserver and some rope and volunteered to swim for a large rock nearby. If he could reach that spot with the line, the other men could use it to get there, too, and they’d be that much closer to shore.', 'They were working through a plan when the Chauncey came into view. Calhoun nearly panicked. All it would take was one strong wake to shove the Young off its perch on the rock. The Chauncey got close enough to hear the Young’s crew—Calhoun loudest of them all—shouting not to collide with their sinking ship.', 'The Delphy’s lights went out. Alone in Watson’s quarters, Dooman couldn’t see a thing. He’d have no choice but to abandon the valise. Dooman returned to the deck, frightened but also appalled to have been forgotten.', 'The ship was low in the sea, and water swamped the deck. Dooman saw some of the crew at the stern, which appeared to be angled higher than the rest of the ship. Higher seemed safer, so he made his way in that direction, pulling himself along by the torpedo rails as waves smashed the deck. When Dooman arrived at the back of the Delphy, he saw that the men had run a line between the ship and a large rock 40 feet from shore. He also saw how dangerous it was—some who’d attempted the crossing had been flung into the water—and he was afraid to risk his life.', 'Dooman decided to run back to the front of the ship, until an officer shined a flashlight in his face. “You’re the passenger,” the officer said. It seemed that Dooman hadn’t been forgotten after all. He asked the man for help, and with the help of another sailor they found a raft stored on deck. They threw it over the side and jumped in, only to realize that it remained lashed to the Delphy. They were stuck. The ship slammed into the tiny craft, threatening to crash on top of them.', 'Dooman had a small penknife attached to his watch chain. He handed it to the sailor, who hacked through the line. With some effort, the raft made it over the waves to the rock. From there they were able to walk to land when the tide receded. One by one, Dooman and the others reached safety.', 'Watson finally made it across the line at 11 p.m. With one exception—Lieutenant Pearson, blinded and lashed to the rigging of a capsized, disintegrating vessel—the captain was the last to leave his ship.', 'The Chauncey threw all its power into reverse, but it was stuck with competing mandates—to avoid a collision with the Young, and to avoid the cliffs of Honda Point. In the end it hit the Young: The undertow hurled the Chauncey’s stern up against the destroyer’s port propeller blades, which ripped into the Chauncey’s starboard hull.', 'Water gushed into the engine room, the ship lost power, and, in a final insult, a wave slammed the Chauncey onto a reef. Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Booth sent down an order to stand by to abandon ship and, like Hunter and Calhoun before him, began weighing strategies to get his crew to shore alive. Perversely, the collision was good news for the Young. Once the Chauncey was firmly stuck on the same reef, it shielded Calhoun’s ship from some of the most turbulent waves.', 'Better still, the Chauncey was fairly close to shore—about 25 yards—and was no longer at risk of sinking. Now all the crew of the Young needed to do was get to the Chauncey, which was about 75 yards away. Members of the Chauncey’s crew succeeded in dragging a pair of lines ashore and setting up as many rafts to ferry the men through the oily waves.', 'Once ashore, the survivors climbed a steep cliff to reach the mainland. A radioman on the Chauncey named Frederick Fish later remembered finding an unconscious crew member of the Young in the water and bringing him to land.\xa0Men from the Delphy were there as well, Fish recalled—“walking about in a dreamlike daze, stumbling and falling, cutting their hands and bare feet on the jagged edges of the cliff.”', 'Looking out at the water, Fish could see the Delphy smashed against a rock and observed its crew shuttle as many men to shore as possible. Before long, Fish heard “the cries for help of an injured man who was lashed there.” That was Pearson. Blodgett from the Delphy was on shore, and he told Fish what had happened—how Pearson was blinded and strapped to the hull of the Delphy. “His calls kept up through the night, and they still ring in my brain,” Fish recalled. “To hear a fellow creature calling for help and not be able to relieve him is the crudest torture possible to man.”', 'On the Young, holding fast to its sinking hull, all the remaining men could do was look on as the crew of the Chauncey worked to save themselves before setting up a line for the other ship. Finally, someone decided not to wait any longer. Peterson, the chief boatswain’s mate, had planned to swim for the rock between the Young and the shore before the Chauncey arrived. Now he was ready to swim to the Chauncey.', 'Peterson took three lengths of line totaling more than 100 yards, found a doughnut-shaped buoy, fastened the line to it, and slipped the buoy over his head. On Calhoun’s order, he dove into the frigid water and made it to the Chauncey in a matter of minutes. A crew member recalled hearing Calhoun shout that a swimmer was coming their way. Once Peterson had been lifted aboard the Chauncey, Herzinger followed using Peterson’s line. “Had he lost his hold,” Calhoun recalled, “he would have been in fuel oil and an angry sea, and would undoubtedly have lost his life.”', 'After Herzinger made it across, the Chauncey sent back a seven-man raft. Evacuations commenced—four men on the first raft, eight on the second, ten on the others. It took 11 crossings to get everyone who could be found off the Young. Calhoun made one last inspection before boarding the final raft. “I want to state that Providence put the Chauncey ashore in that place,” Calhoun later said. “It is absolutely certain in my mind that the loss of the Chauncey saved half of the crew of my ship or more.”', 'There was one additional consolation: Fireman Scott, who had volunteered to shut down the Young’s boiler, finally reappeared at about 10:30 p.m., when the lighthouse keepers on shore heard cries for help from the bottom of the bluffs—five surviving sailors, including Scott. He’d made it off the Young and into the water but was unconscious, and when he awoke he clung to a piece of flotsam; he’d floated for an hour before being hauled aboard a raft.', 'Calhoun knew that not everyone from his ship had made it. He wondered how many still flailed in the oil-coated water. And the engine- and fire-room crews deep inside the ship: had they been trapped down below, or were they pulled out by the undertow as the ship rolled? Those men—his men—had been 150 yards from shore with no way out of the ship.', 'On shore, when Herzinger mentioned to Calhoun that the losses were great, as many as 20 or 30 sailors, the young captain’s response was grave: “My God, I know—but we will not discuss it now.”', 'The rescue efforts were just getting underway as the remaining ships neared Honda Point, still following the leader. For some it was too late to change course. One after another, they smashed into the shore—a seven-ship pileup on the California coast—hitting rocks, reefs, and, in some cases, one another.', 'The officers of the Woodbury saw lights ahead of the other ships and assumed a man was overboard. They reversed engines, but not soon enough to avoid ramming a large boulder.', 'The Nicholas struck a reef, and the pounding surf spun the boat until it pointed out to sea. The oil, the rocks, and the darkness made lowering rafts impossible; the men had to wait all night for a lifeline from shore.', 'Then came the Farragut, named for the great Civil War hero. Lieutenant Commander J. F. McClain ordered a full stop, but reversing the engines doused the ship’s lights. Suddenly, it was dark again, and the Fuller, next in the squadron line, collided with the Farragut before hitting a pinnacle rock—the same one that had claimed the Woodbury.', 'The ships at the back of Watson’s column, the Percival and the Somers, had time and space enough to change course. The last division—the Paul Hamilton, the Stoddert, and the Thompson—never took the turn into the channel.', 'Along the shore, an entire community was mobilizing to help rescue the sailors still in the water. The ships’ sirens had woken nearby residents, who loaded their cars with blankets, hot coffee, and food, and rushed to the steep bluff. A fishing captain, Giacomo Noceti, bravely ferried his boat to the edge of the rocks and retrieved some 150 men with lines. A nearby rail station became a headquarters for relief workers, who brought aid in and shipped rescued sailors out. A passing train took the injured to Santa Barbara hospitals, and later that day another transported 38 officers and 517 enlisted men to the naval base in San Diego.', 'The Delphy snapped in two just five minutes after everyone except Pearson had evacuated. The ship’s searchlight tower leaned farther over with each barrage of waves, until it dragged the rest of the ship over and down. The section of the deck where Pearson had been tied up was pulled into the ocean. He was one of the Delphy’s three casualties that night.', 'How many were lost from the rest of the fleet wouldn’t be known for hours. Through it all, Watson checked on the injured, organized search parties, tallied his men, and reported back to naval headquarters. By morning, he was preparing to send salvage parties back to the ships and arranging for the care of survivors. Even Calhoun, grappling with unspeakable losses, would later praise the commander, stating, “I only hope that if ever I am faced with the tragedy that faced him that night, I’ll be half the man that he was: cool, calm, courageous, and thoughtful; never missing an opportunity to aid.” But in idle moments, alone with his thoughts, Watson seemed to Dooman years older.', 'When a search party returned with the body of Fireman Conway, who had fallen from a rescue line into the water, Watson approached the stretcher. He raised the blanket and looked down on Conway for a long moment. Then, silently, the captain unbuckled the sword he wore and laid it beside the body.', 'Was he thinking about all the men—some 300 or so, as he estimated early on—who might be dead because of the decision he’d signed off on?', 'Was he thinking about his friend Dooman, there only because of his invitation? Or his daughter, who’d been promised a spot, and how lucky it was she hadn’t been aboard?', 'Was he thinking about his wider family? His father and the legacy of the Watsons, that night on the Hartford in 1864 and Captain Farragut’s cry of “Damn the torpedoes!”? Did he sense any connection between that historic moment and his decision to push forward at all costs?', 'There would be time for him to mull these questions—to sift through everything that had happened—later on that night, in the weeks and months to come, and for the rest of his life.', '3.', 'In the space of just ten minutes, the Navy lost more ships than it had during all of World War I. Seven destroyers ran aground, one after another, each with more than 100 men aboard. Some of them split in two on the rocks. They collided with one another. They hemorrhaged oil—some 300,000 gallons covering 800 acres.', 'Twenty-three sailors lost their lives: three on the Delphy, twenty on the Young. A miracle by some measures, a debacle by others. Of the men trapped inside the Young, most probably fought through smoke and gas, darkness and freezing water. None made it to shore. Those who didn’t drown immediately were caught in the ebbing tide and sucked out to sea.', 'The disaster was front-page news around the country. Some 10,000 people turned up for a memorial service in San Diego. A week later, hundreds of visitors from Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, and other nearby towns flocked to the cliffs above Honda Point to view the wreckage. Demand to visit the scene was so high that a special train was provided on Sunday. Many packed a lunch and remained on the bluffs all day.', 'The day after the disaster, Navy secretary Edwin Denby seized on the great Kanto earthquake as the explanation. It was because of the quake, he suggested—an act of God, with unthinkable ramifications an ocean away—that nothing went as planned on the water that day. It explained why the ships never really reached 20 knots. Usually, the current pushed ships south; on that day it pushed them north. “One of the destroyers was broken in two, and it seems as if she was carried bodily up and dropped,” Denby marveled.', 'Others blamed technology: that infuriating RDF, sending good sailors astray, undermining their expertise. “The theory was advanced by mariners,” The Washington Post reported, “that the compass bearings taken from a nearby shore station as guidance through the fog, had been transmitted erroneously.”', 'Yet to some the weather and the obscure compass readings only explained so much. The Navy scheduled an inquiry for Monday, September 17. Depending on the outcome, the next step could involve court-martials. That left a week for the press to point fingers. “There has been a peculiar reluctance on the part of officers responsible for full and prompt reports of what happened,” a New York Times editorial declared. “For the honor of the United States Navy and for the good of the service those who were responsible should be made to suffer for it.”', 'Among those who might bear responsibility, Watson was an ideal target. Not only had he been the one in charge, but he offered a newspaper-ready narrative: an admiral’s son, wealthy and connected, now facing utter disgrace. Watson and the ship commanders hunkered in San Diego, awaiting the inquiry in silence. Those close to Watson encouraged him to try and stop what was coming. His brother Loyall urged him to stand firm and defend himself. His brother-in-law, Clifford Gratz, wanted to leverage his family’s relationship with the Rockefellers to spare Watson and help stave off any embarrassment to the family. Naval Academy friends worked back channels, pleading for leniency.\xa0', 'But there was one person whose opinion mattered more than any other. On September 16, retired rear admiral John Crittenden Watson, then 80 and in fragile health, wrote to his son from his home in Washington, D.C. “I knew the saving of all the lives possible would be the greatest comfort to you and our dear Hermine,” the elder Watson wrote. “Like both of you, our thought is that you were able to save not only your own life but to assist others.”', 'With its measured tone, the admiral’s letter spoke volumes. There was no assurance of his son’s guiltlessness—no proclamation that, faced with the day’s beguiling circumstances, he would have acted the same. The message was clear: A man’s fate mattered less than his reputation. The family’s honor rested with Watson now.', 'Typically, Navy inquiries are confidential, as with a grand jury in a criminal case. But the press demanded that they be allowed to watch, and Denby relented. As the inquiry got underway, its public nature seemed more than anything to dictate what would become of Watson and his commanders. No one wished to give any impression that mercy would be shown to the men behind the worst peacetime disaster in Navy history.', 'Watson and his commanders wouldn’t be allowed to testify; as they were possible defendants in court-martial proceedings, anything they said could expose them to prosecution. Only one senior crew member of the Delphy was called to testify: Laurence Blodgett, Hunter’s second-in-command. “We were satisfied that the Arguello radio station was wrong,” Blodgett explained from the stand. “They kept giving our position north and to the west of Point Arguello, and when we could not make this check with our figures, we finally took the reciprocal of their bearings, which would show us already in the Santa Barbara Channel.” As soon as he finished, the prosecutor asked to add Blodgett to the defendant list too. His role in making navigation decisions transformed him, in the eyes of the court, from a bystander to a suspect. Off the stand he went; the defense never had a chance to cross-examine him.', 'This was a search for scapegoats—but should the ships’ commanders have expected anything different? Watson at least was desperate to have his say. Just days after the worst possible thing that could have happened on his watch came to pass, he was staring down what he considered another disaster. The men under his command—the ones who’d followed his lead—were about to lose their reputations and livelihoods. This could be why, on the inquiry’s second day, Watson made his first public comments about Honda Point. “The responsibility for the course of the destroyer squadron was mine, a responsibility which I fully realized,” he told a reporter for a news service, whose story would appear in papers around the country in the days to come. “But that decision was based upon 33 years of experience in the Navy, and made after due consideration of reports of our position from the Point Arguello radio station, which were confusing.”', 'It was part mea culpa, part dogged display. Watson continued on like this, switching from accepting blame to explaining why, given the weather and the cryptic RDF readings, anyone in his position would have done the same thing. “The condition of visibility, remember, was such that we were unable to get our true position from the stars. We were compelled to rely upon the radio station. I asked for our bearings repeatedly. From about 6:30 until 8 o’clock p.m., that most vital period in our lives, we were unable to get radio bearings from the station. I accept that responsibility. I made a naval officer’s decision. I was content the radio station was wrong. And that is why I gave the order.”', 'On September 22, Watson issued a similar statement to the court of inquiry and to the press: “The Squadron Commander hopes the responsibility for this disaster, which he considers entirely his own, may not descend upon the able and loyal subordinates who supported him on all occasions.” Watson was sacrificing himself, throwing himself into the prosecution’s line of fire. He also asked the court to waive its rule barring potential defendants from testifying—in effect, making himself more vulnerable to court-martial so that he could have his say now.', 'The court granted Watson’s request, and he was permitted to take the stand on September 24. “The responsibility was mine,” he said. “I was convinced that the station was wrong. But they were right.”', 'The court of inquiry’s president, Rear Admiral William V. Pratt, attempted to pick apart this blanket admission. “Do you feel,” he asked Watson, “that you can assume all of the responsibility that at times must fall on the shoulders of your division commanders?”', '“I have no desire to assume their responsibilities,” Watson replied. “I simply want to make clear that I assume all of my own.”', 'Watson braced himself for a public flogging. So perhaps he was as surprised as anyone when the opposite occurred. Almost overnight, the squadron commander transformed—in the eyes of the public, at least—from the incompetent scion of a naval legend to a paragon of selflessness and sacrifice. More than one newspaper editorial used the word “manliness” to describe what he’d done.', '“Capt. Watson has given a splendid example of the finest attributes of character overcoming the elemental instinct of self-preservation,” the Army and Navy Journal declared, while the San Diego Sun waxed on about Watson’s “heroic” soul. “He waits for no court martial. He relies not on lawyers. He seeks no avenue of evasion. He resorts to no subterfuge. Lest the blame rest on some innocent man, he takes upon himself full responsibility for his actions.”', 'Others around the country joined the chorus, taking Watson’s testimony as their cue to examine what true leadership really meant. “The heroism of captain Watson is of a different type,” declared the Santa Monica Evening Gazette. “It manifests itself after deliberation; after the weighing of consequences.” And this from the San Francisco Chronicle: “From the moment the ship struck, his bearing and speech have been that of a most remarkable example of real manliness under the most distressing conditions which an officer in his position can ever meet.”', 'The goodwill seemed to play a part in Watson persuading the other officers named as defendants to join him in testifying, so that they also would have the chance to recount what had happened that night. This was no small thing: By opening themselves to prosecution, these officers had to have faith that Watson’s contrition would reflect well on them. Admiral Pratt called their decision to testify “worthy of the best traditions of the Navy.”\xa0', 'When the Delphy’s skipper, Hunter, testified, he also made sure to blame the technology, as Watson had. “I’ll have to admit that it was an error in judgment,” he testified. “But as contributing causes I believe … the fact that a bilateral radio compass is used there were partly responsible.” Hunter also floated the “possibility” that “abnormal currents caused by the Japanese earthquake” contributed to the problem. In response, the lieutenant commander in charge of the Point Arguello lighthouse took the stand, defending his compass bearings that night. In fact, the readings had been within a few degrees of accuracy the whole time, even if one of them had required a reciprocal adjustment.', 'Many of Watson’s other commanders said that they weren’t responsible for what had happened because they’d been duty-bound to follow the Delphy’s lead. The Navy’s sacred adherence to chain of command suddenly was on trial, too. Robert Morris, the commander of the division of ships immediately astern of the Delphy, said that they “could not possibly be held culpable in carrying out the destroyer doctrine of following their leader.” Rear Admiral Pratt asked Morris, “Does seniority take the place of common sense?” Morris replied, “They are supposed to be synonymous.”', 'Not every skipper had hewed so tightly to that edict. Thomas A. Symington of the Thompson, the last ship in line, said that once he’d noticed the confusion of lights and sirens ahead, he slowed down to take soundings. Leslie Bratton of the Stoddert said that he’d opted to violate the no-navigation order and asked the lighthouse for radio bearings himself, then steered his ship away in time to avoid disaster. Hardy B. Page, navigator of the Hamilton, said that he’d suspected there was a problem ahead and advised his commanding officer to get word to the division commander—a decision that helped the division’s three ships escape intact.', 'Finally, the board heard from Walter Roper—the division commander who a few hours before the disaster had jousted with Watson by radio about helping the Cuba. Roper was as flinty on the stand as he’d been that night on the water. “I’m not a desk man. My experience comes from hard knocks,” he said, a jab at Watson’s lack of experience and Hunter’s academy training. “There are too many book-learned and not enough practical men running the Navy.” In Roper’s view, those on the Delphy should never have assumed that the ship really was going 20 knots in such choppy water. The error, he said, was in putting “too much reliance on computation of speed by propeller revolutions.” In his experience, he said, he’d seen propellers indicate 20 knots when the ship was in fact going only 12.', 'Roper made a point of saying that he would have heeded the lighthouse. “I have gone into the most dangerous harbors in the world through impenetrable fogs, guided almost wholly by radio compass,” he said. His division had never turned left, he testified, because he never came close to trusting the Delphy. “I was positive we had not passed Point Arguello. I did not know the forward ships were turning. Could I have seen them, I would not have followed, but instead would have tried to stop them. My motto is ‘Never try to turn a corner until you have passed.’\u202f”', 'Rear Admiral Pratt asked Roper if he would have turned left had he been on the ship behind the Delphy. “Of course I would not,” Roper said. “\u202f‘Follow the leader’ is all right, but it should be tempered with common sense. When I was a boy, our leader once jumped off a barn. I stayed put—and walked down to pick him up. He had a broken leg.” The room erupted with laughter.', 'But the fact remained that Roper failed to speak up against Watson at the time. Had he been stinging from their quarrel over the Cuba? If he’d said something—one of many ifs that night—might the entire disaster have been avoided, and 23 lives spared?', 'On October 12, the court of inquiry made its determination. Never mind the weather and the radio; the Honda Point disaster, the court ruled, was the result of “bad errors and faulty navigation.” Faced with so much uncertainty, the ships should have slowed down to take depth soundings. Following the leader may have been a Navy tradition, but it shouldn’t trump reason.', 'Eleven officers were recommended for court-martial. Watson, Hunter, and Blodgett were charged with “culpable inefficiency and negligence,” and eight others with simple negligence. But the court seemed gripped by contradictory impulses. It issued a letter to Calhoun, the Young’s commander, commending him “for coolness, intelligence, and seamanlike ability,” and to Walter D. Seed, of the Fuller, for “great bravery in swimming … about seventy five yards, through a rough and turbulent sea … for the salvage of the crew.” Yet both also faced charges of negligence.', 'The court-martial proceedings took place in rapid succession during the month of November. All eyes remained on Watson. Would his penitence spare the others? On November 7, Watson doubled down with another public statement. “I am ready and anxious to take my medicine. I don’t want an acquittal. For me to be acquitted by this court would be bad for the naval service, to which both my father and myself have devoted our lives.”', 'Calhoun, at his trial, went out of his way to commend Watson. He testified that in his opinion no power on earth could have saved the Young and the other ships after the Delphy ran aground. Calhoun insisted that he had no reason to suspect the Delphy of any errors, and testified that he and the Young’s crew would not have done anything differently had they been at the front of the line—except perhaps take soundings.', 'Watson reciprocated as a witness at Calhoun’s trial. “Every man of the crew of the Young owes his life solely and entirely to Commander Calhoun,” he testified.', 'In his summation speech in Watson’s trial, Watson’s lawyer, Thomas T. Craven, noted how, at Honda Point, “fate was indeed stern upon this occasion.” If the Delphy had continued south for just a few more minutes before turning, the entire column of ships would have cleared the rocks. If they’d turned a few minutes sooner, the coast would have been more forgiving, resulting in less damage and fewer lives lost. How many Navy men, Craven asked, had made similarly small missteps and escaped the hand of fate? Watson, he suggested, was a victim of bad luck.', 'Calhoun was acquitted after 40 minutes of deliberation. Blodgett, the Delphy’s navigator, was also acquitted, as were seven other defendants. There were just two convictions:\xa0Edward Howe Watson and Donald T. Hunter would not escape official blame for what happened that night. But considering the scale of the catastrophe, their sentences were lighter than expected. Both Watson and Hunter were allowed to continue their military careers, but with lower ranking numbers, which virtually eliminated the possibility of promotion. Neither would command a ship again, but they would retain their ranks. And the careers of the other men would be saved.', '“It is a very proper sentence,” Watson told reporters. “It is a fitting punishment. The loss of a few numbers could not be a sufficient punishment for an error as great as mine was. I am glad that the sentence is as severe as it is. It puts me very near the bottom of the list of captains, I guess. Needless to say, it does not make me happy.”', 'Watson had transformed from a villain to a hero with his admission in September. Now, in December, with his career intact, things changed again. Back Watson went, from hero to goat. Yet, by taking the blame, had Watson—no matter how gallant the gesture—simply given the Navy a smooth path toward putting the embarrassing episode behind it? And was the Navy now rewarding Watson for his contrition? After the loss of seven ships and 23 lives, how was it exactly that not one member of the Navy had lost their job?', '“Just learned court-martial has been very lenient with everybody,” President Calvin Coolidge said. Navy Secretary Denby also made sure to grumble publicly that the “sentence in [Watson’s] case is inadequate.”', 'On December 29, the Army and Navy Journal reported, “The light sentence created almost as great a sensation at Washington as the disaster.”', 'Eugene Dooman’s escape from the scene at Honda Point occurred just before dawn after the wrecks, when a train to Los Angeles approached the local station where the relief efforts were headquartered. Watson told Dooman and a few others to board it. Hundreds of other men would be taking the San Diego train a few hours later. Dooman, like many in the squadron, was covered from head to foot with oil, so a conductor placed some newspapers on the seat, and off they went. In Los Angeles, Dooman was on his own again, delivered from the tragedy—and from the official narrative.', 'The available record from the court of inquiry and Watson’s court-martial includes just one mention of a civilian on the Delphy, but Dooman’s name never appears. In the years to come, as military and civilian historians researched the Honda Point disaster, the idea of a not-spoken-for witness to the disaster proved tantalizing. He was called the “mystery guest,” the “civilian,” the “phantom passenger.” Rumors circulated that he and Watson had been drinking that day (Watson and others denied this), or that Watson subsequently swore him to silence about what really went wrong that night. But while Dooman’s identity was never well publicized, it was never really secret either. In January 1924, he gave a long interview to an English-language paper in Japan, complimenting Watson’s performance on the night of the wreck and relating the tale of his own escape. Had the historians and writers seen that article, the mystery would have been solved.', 'After 30 years as a diplomat in Tokyo, Dooman came home to America after Pearl Harbor, retiring just a few years later, in 1945. It took until the 1960s for him to be located and asked about Honda Point. “I am not competent” to pass judgment on Watson’s decisions that day, he wrote one interlocutor in 1966. “That is to say, I cannot weigh the extenuating circumstances, but a disaster did occur and the man who made the decision had to assume responsibility.”', 'Dooman was asked why he was never called to testify in the inquiry, and what happened to the $3,000 in silver he’d brought on board. The answers, it turned out, were linked. The silver was sacrificed, Dooman wrote, in the name of discretion. The money had been found in the wreckage, he wrote, “but could not be claimed without the probability of being called as a witness in the court-martial, and Watson and his defense officer were afraid that my testimony might prove harmful to Watson, since I was with him when the ship struck.” By today’s standards, these actions would have constituted a cover-up. But every answer Dooman gave seemed to prompt more questions. Why had the Navy not asked him to testify? Did his job in the State Department play a part in that decision? Or was the Navy afraid that additional testimony from a civilian passenger would add yet more unwelcome intrigue to a debacle it wished would just go away?', 'Dooman wouldn’t say. But he and Watson remained friends for years. A few days after the disaster, Dooman explained, with the inquiry not yet begun, he’d paid a visit to Watson and his wife at their home in San Diego. (Some armchair historians, parsing the disaster’s themes of negligence and culpability, have gone so far as to wonder if the captain reimbursed Dooman his lost $3,000 in return for his discretion. If such a thing occurred, Dooman never mentioned it.) The Watsons would later visit Japan, in 1937, and dine with Dooman there. He curtly alluded to the price Watson paid for the tragedy, the toll it took on him. “After the disaster,” Dooman wrote, “he lost his zest for living and became very despondent.”', 'Just after the court-martial, Dooman wrote a letter to Watson, one of dozens sent by friends and well-wishers hoping to soften the blow. “Do you know what a splendid impression you have made on everybody,” the diplomat wrote from Washington, “not only those high in the Navy but the man in the street? I dined with Admiral Knight who said splendid things about you. I think you will appreciate even more, though, what I overheard in the cars the other day—‘Well,’ said one, ‘I don’t get this stuff about the compass, but as long as we have fellows in the Navy like this guy who took the blame we shouldn’t worry.’\u202f”', 'William Calhoun was cleared of any blame for the Young’s tragedy; he was even commended for his cool demeanor during the rescue. But the loss of 20 men weighed heavily on him, and for a time it seemed foolish to assume that Calhoun would command a ship again. Eventually, however, his career righted itself. After serving on several ships, further instruction at the Naval War College, and a stint as an instructor at the Naval Academy, Calhoun returned to sea as commanding officer of the USS Rochester, and later the USS California. In 1938, he was promoted to rear admiral. The next year, he became commander of the Navy’s Pacific base in Honolulu and remained in that position through World War II. “There was nothing the fleet wanted that Uncle Bill wouldn’t get,” one commander would say.', 'Calhoun retired in 1946 a four-star admiral, after 44 years of active service. There was just one thing missing from his time at sea: He never saw battle. For that he’d be granted some satisfaction from the author James A. Michener, who’d been a lieutenant commander under Calhoun during the war. “Those of us who worked for Uncle Billy believed that he had played a major role in smothering the Japanese with matériel,” Michener wrote in his memoirs, “and the fighting admirals agreed.” In Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific—the Pulitzer Prize–winning basis for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical—Calhoun is said to be the model for Millard Kester, a grounded admiral who finally gets to do battle at sea, leading an entire invasion force. And winning.', 'Calhoun died in 1963; he had married and was a grandfather many times over. In 1984, some 61 years after the disaster, a scuba diver and amateur treasure hunter exploring the California coast noticed something shiny on the ocean floor, churned up by a recent storm: a class ring from the Naval Academy. It didn’t take long to connect the ring to its deceased owner. The diver had hoped to make some money for a discovery from the site of the disaster. One collector offered him $1,500. Then a fellow diver let him know that Calhoun’s widow, Rosalie, was alive and living in Coronado, near San Diego. Her phone number was listed. He agreed to sell the ring to her for $400—the cost of the dive, he said.', 'Rosalie had never remarried. The ring, when the diver handed it over, stirred something in her. “It’s like part of him was brought back,” she said, filled with emotion for her lost husband.', 'On December 14, 1923, six days after Edward Howe Watson’s conviction in a Navy court-martial, his father, retired admiral John Crittenden Watson, died at 81. A fellow retired admiral, Colby M. Chester, wrote to the younger Watson that same day: “Your name was the last one uttered by your father, and I know how happy the Honda affair made him.” Happy that\xa0his son’s career was intact, perhaps. Or that the family name had, despite everything, retained some of its dignity.\xa0', 'On January 10, 1924, Watson along with his wife and daughter moved to Honolulu, where he was stationed until his retirement five years later. In the 1930s, the Watsons lived in New York and then in Jamestown, Rhode Island, visiting Japan several times. In the years before World War II, Watson indulged his fascination with Japan, writing poems about historic Japanese figures. That other existence he might have led before Honda Point—the life of a sly and insightful Navy attaché, drawing out spies and supplying Washington with essential information about a potentially lethal foe—seemed to loom large for him.', 'In the late 1930s, Watson drafted a long policy memo about Japan to a friend at the Naval War College, still hoping someone would heed his warnings—“stuff that I have worked up during the past 5 years, since my retirement,” as he described it. “Perhaps it will help to save many hours to some fellow who is doing a bit of research work on the subject. Dispose of it as your judgment dictates. Either in the files or by burning.”', 'Watson died of heart disease in a Navy hospital on January 7, 1942, a month to the day after Pearl Harbor proved his point. His family later said that they thought the attack had hastened his death. Honda Point was not mentioned in any of his published obituaries.', 'Watson had pursued a life of significance, of honor. At Honda Point, the son emulated the father, following the traditions of leadership codified by an entire generation—and those same traditions contributed to the disaster. But after the worst happened, and the nation had judged him, he chose to preserve his character. In doing so, he acquired a different kind of significance, one he hadn’t expected.', 'In his papers, there is a letter from Watson’s father written on October 1, 1923, just after Watson had publicly accepted responsibility for the error that cost the Navy seven ships and 23 lives. In its tone, the letter was far warmer and more effusive than the one that had preceded it. “I cannot express in any words how proud we are of you and of your devoted wife,” the father wrote.', 'In the letter, Watson’s father offered his son a gift. He said that a relative of the late Admiral David Farragut had written to him “to express his confidence in you,” and sent along a precious keepsake: a makeshift tourniquet the elder Watson had made aboard the Hartford during the Civil War, “just as we were about to pass up the Mississippi by the Confederate batteries.”', 'Farragut had given this rag—a relic of John Crittenden’s most glorious moment in the Navy—to his own son “to use in case of a wound.” Now it seemed that someone else had a better use for it. “When I wrote him I know you would love to have it, he sent it to me,” Watson’s father wrote. “I will hold it for you until you come East. All of us join in ever much love to all three of you.”', 'And so Edward Howe Watson was offered a tourniquet—a message from father to son. His son was wounded and needed care. His son was worthy of greatness. His son was a Watson. And in court his son had not shirked from his duty to do what the father never had to do: go down with his ship.', '© 2023 The Atavist Magazine.

Alone in Watson’s quarters, Dooman couldn’t see a thing. He’d have no choice but to abandon the valise. Dooman returned to the deck, frightened but also appalled to have been forgotten.', 'The ship was low in the sea, and water swamped the deck. Dooman saw some of the crew at the stern, which appeared to be angled higher than the rest of the ship. Higher seemed safer, so he made his way in that direction, pulling himself along by the torpedo rails as waves smashed the deck. When Dooman arrived at the back of the Delphy, he saw that the men had run a line between the ship and a large rock 40 feet from shore. He also saw how dangerous it was—some who’d attempted the crossing had been flung into the water—and he was afraid to risk his life.', 'Dooman decided to run back to the front of the ship, until an officer shined a flashlight in his face. “You’re the passenger,” the officer said. It seemed that Dooman hadn’t been forgotten after all. He asked the man for help, and with the help of another sailor they found a raft stored on deck. They threw it over the side and jumped in, only to realize that it remained lashed to the Delphy. They were stuck. The ship slammed into the tiny craft, threatening to crash on top of them.', 'Dooman had a small penknife attached to his watch chain. He handed it to the sailor, who hacked through the line. With some effort, the raft made it over the waves to the rock. From there they were able to walk to land when the tide receded. One by one, Dooman and the others reached safety.', 'Watson finally made it across the line at 11 p.m. With one exception—Lieutenant Pearson, blinded and lashed to the rigging of a capsized, disintegrating vessel—the captain was the last to leave his ship.', 'The Chauncey threw all its power into reverse, but it was stuck with competing mandates—to avoid a collision with the Young, and to avoid the cliffs of Honda Point. In the end it hit the Young: The undertow hurled the Chauncey’s stern up against the destroyer’s port propeller blades, which ripped into the Chauncey’s starboard hull.', 'Water gushed into the engine room, the ship lost power, and, in a final insult, a wave slammed the Chauncey onto a reef. Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Booth sent down an order to stand by to abandon ship and, like Hunter and Calhoun before him, began weighing strategies to get his crew to shore alive. Perversely, the collision was good news for the Young. Once the Chauncey was firmly stuck on the same reef, it shielded Calhoun’s ship from some of the most turbulent waves.', 'Better still, the Chauncey was fairly close to shore—about 25 yards—and was no longer at risk of sinking. Now all the crew of the Young needed to do was get to the Chauncey, which was about 75 yards away. Members of the Chauncey’s crew succeeded in dragging a pair of lines ashore and setting up as many rafts to ferry the men through the oily waves.', 'Once ashore, the survivors climbed a steep cliff to reach the mainland. A radioman on the Chauncey named Frederick Fish later remembered finding an unconscious crew member of the Young in the water and bringing him to land.\xa0Men from the Delphy were there as well, Fish recalled—“walking about in a dreamlike daze, stumbling and falling, cutting their hands and bare feet on the jagged edges of the cliff.”', 'Looking out at the water, Fish could see the Delphy smashed against a rock and observed its crew shuttle as many men to shore as possible. Before long, Fish heard “the cries for help of an injured man who was lashed there.” That was Pearson. Blodgett from the Delphy was on shore, and he told Fish what had happened—how Pearson was blinded and strapped to the hull of the Delphy. “His calls kept up through the night, and they still ring in my brain,” Fish recalled. “To hear a fellow creature calling for help and not be able to relieve him is the crudest torture possible to man.”', 'On the Young, holding fast to its sinking hull, all the remaining men could do was look on as the crew of the Chauncey worked to save themselves before setting up a line for the other ship. Finally, someone decided not to wait any longer. Peterson, the chief boatswain’s mate, had planned to swim for the rock between the Young and the shore before the Chauncey arrived. Now he was ready to swim to the Chauncey.', 'Peterson took three lengths of line totaling more than 100 yards, found a doughnut-shaped buoy, fastened the line to it, and slipped the buoy over his head. On Calhoun’s order, he dove into the frigid water and made it to the Chauncey in a matter of minutes. A crew member recalled hearing Calhoun shout that a swimmer was coming their way. Once Peterson had been lifted aboard the Chauncey, Herzinger followed using Peterson’s line. “Had he lost his hold,” Calhoun recalled, “he would have been in fuel oil and an angry sea, and would undoubtedly have lost his life.”', 'After Herzinger made it across, the Chauncey sent back a seven-man raft. Evacuations commenced—four men on the first raft, eight on the second, ten on the others. It took 11 crossings to get everyone who could be found off the Young. Calhoun made one last inspection before boarding the final raft. “I want to state that Providence put the Chauncey ashore in that place,” Calhoun later said. “It is absolutely certain in my mind that the loss of the Chauncey saved half of the crew of my ship or more.”', 'There was one additional consolation: Fireman Scott, who had volunteered to shut down the Young’s boiler, finally reappeared at about 10:30 p.m., when the lighthouse keepers on shore heard cries for help from the bottom of the bluffs—five surviving sailors, including Scott. He’d made it off the Young and into the water but was unconscious, and when he awoke he clung to a piece of flotsam; he’d floated for an hour before being hauled aboard a raft.', 'Calhoun knew that not everyone from his ship had made it. He wondered how many still flailed in the oil-coated water. And the engine- and fire-room crews deep inside the ship: had they been trapped down below, or were they pulled out by the undertow as the ship rolled? Those men—his men—had been 150 yards from shore with no way out of the ship.', 'On shore, when Herzinger mentioned to Calhoun that the losses were great, as many as 20 or 30 sailors, the young captain’s response was grave: “My God, I know—but we will not discuss it now.”', 'The rescue efforts were just getting underway as the remaining ships neared Honda Point, still following the leader. For some it was too late to change course. One after another, they smashed into the shore—a seven-ship pileup on the California coast—hitting rocks, reefs, and, in some cases, one another.', 'The officers of the Woodbury saw lights ahead of the other ships and assumed a man was overboard. They reversed engines, but not soon enough to avoid ramming a large boulder.', 'The Nicholas struck a reef, and the pounding surf spun the boat until it pointed out to sea. The oil, the rocks, and the darkness made lowering rafts impossible; the men had to wait all night for a lifeline from shore.', 'Then came the Farragut, named for the great Civil War hero. Lieutenant Commander J. F. McClain ordered a full stop, but reversing the engines doused the ship’s lights. Suddenly, it was dark again, and the Fuller, next in the squadron line, collided with the Farragut before hitting a pinnacle rock—the same one that had claimed the Woodbury.', 'The ships at the back of Watson’s column, the Percival and the Somers, had time and space enough to change course. The last division—the Paul Hamilton, the Stoddert, and the Thompson—never took the turn into the channel.', 'Along the shore, an entire community was mobilizing to help rescue the sailors still in the water. The ships’ sirens had woken nearby residents, who loaded their cars with blankets, hot coffee, and food, and rushed to the steep bluff. A fishing captain, Giacomo Noceti, bravely ferried his boat to the edge of the rocks and retrieved some 150 men with lines. A nearby rail station became a headquarters for relief workers, who brought aid in and shipped rescued sailors out. A passing train took the injured to Santa Barbara hospitals, and later that day another transported 38 officers and 517 enlisted men to the naval base in San Diego.', 'The Delphy snapped in two just five minutes after everyone except Pearson had evacuated. The ship’s searchlight tower leaned farther over with each barrage of waves, until it dragged the rest of the ship over and down. The section of the deck where Pearson had been tied up was pulled into the ocean. He was one of the Delphy’s three casualties that night.', 'How many were lost from the rest of the fleet wouldn’t be known for hours. Through it all, Watson checked on the injured, organized search parties, tallied his men, and reported back to naval headquarters. By morning, he was preparing to send salvage parties back to the ships and arranging for the care of survivors. Even Calhoun, grappling with unspeakable losses, would later praise the commander, stating, “I only hope that if ever I am faced with the tragedy that faced him that night, I’ll be half the man that he was: cool, calm, courageous, and thoughtful; never missing an opportunity to aid.” But in idle moments, alone with his thoughts, Watson seemed to Dooman years older.', 'When a search party returned with the body of Fireman Conway, who had fallen from a rescue line into the water, Watson approached the stretcher. He raised the blanket and looked down on Conway for a long moment. Then, silently, the captain unbuckled the sword he wore and laid it beside the body.', 'Was he thinking about all the men—some 300 or so, as he estimated early on—who might be dead because of the decision he’d signed off on?', 'Was he thinking about his friend Dooman, there only because of his invitation? Or his daughter, who’d been promised a spot, and how lucky it was she hadn’t been aboard?', 'Was he thinking about his wider family? His father and the legacy of the Watsons, that night on the Hartford in 1864 and Captain Farragut’s cry of “Damn the torpedoes!”? Did he sense any connection between that historic moment and his decision to push forward at all costs?', 'There would be time for him to mull these questions—to sift through everything that had happened—later on that night, in the weeks and months to come, and for the rest of his life.', '3.', 'In the space of just ten minutes, the Navy lost more ships than it had during all of World War I. Seven destroyers ran aground, one after another, each with more than 100 men aboard. Some of them split in two on the rocks. They collided with one another. They hemorrhaged oil—some 300,000 gallons covering 800 acres.', 'Twenty-three sailors lost their lives: three on the Delphy, twenty on the Young. A miracle by some measures, a debacle by others. Of the men trapped inside the Young, most probably fought through smoke and gas, darkness and freezing water. None made it to shore. Those who didn’t drown immediately were caught in the ebbing tide and sucked out to sea.', 'The disaster was front-page news around the country. Some 10,000 people turned up for a memorial service in San Diego. A week later, hundreds of visitors from Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, and other nearby towns flocked to the cliffs above Honda Point to view the wreckage. Demand to visit the scene was so high that a special train was provided on Sunday. Many packed a lunch and remained on the bluffs all day.', 'The day after the disaster, Navy secretary Edwin Denby seized on the great Kanto earthquake as the explanation. It was because of the quake, he suggested—an act of God, with unthinkable ramifications an ocean away—that nothing went as planned on the water that day. It explained why the ships never really reached 20 knots. Usually, the current pushed ships south; on that day it pushed them north. “One of the destroyers was broken in two, and it seems as if she was carried bodily up and dropped,” Denby marveled.', 'Others blamed technology: that infuriating RDF, sending good sailors astray, undermining their expertise. “The theory was advanced by mariners,” The Washington Post reported, “that the compass bearings taken from a nearby shore station as guidance through the fog, had been transmitted erroneously.”', 'Yet to some the weather and the obscure compass readings only explained so much. The Navy scheduled an inquiry for Monday, September 17. Depending on the outcome, the next step could involve court-martials. That left a week for the press to point fingers. “There has been a peculiar reluctance on the part of officers responsible for full and prompt reports of what happened,” a New York Times editorial declared. “For the honor of the United States Navy and for the good of the service those who were responsible should be made to suffer for it.”', 'Among those who might bear responsibility, Watson was an ideal target. Not only had he been the one in charge, but he offered a newspaper-ready narrative: an admiral’s son, wealthy and connected, now facing utter disgrace. Watson and the ship commanders hunkered in San Diego, awaiting the inquiry in silence. Those close to Watson encouraged him to try and stop what was coming. His brother Loyall urged him to stand firm and defend himself. His brother-in-law, Clifford Gratz, wanted to leverage his family’s relationship with the Rockefellers to spare Watson and help stave off any embarrassment to the family. Naval Academy friends worked back channels, pleading for leniency.\xa0', 'But there was one person whose opinion mattered more than any other. On September 16, retired rear admiral John Crittenden Watson, then 80 and in fragile health, wrote to his son from his home in Washington, D.C. “I knew the saving of all the lives possible would be the greatest comfort to you and our dear Hermine,” the elder Watson wrote. “Like both of you, our thought is that you were able to save not only your own life but to assist others.”', 'With its measured tone, the admiral’s letter spoke volumes. There was no assurance of his son’s guiltlessness—no proclamation that, faced with the day’s beguiling circumstances, he would have acted the same. The message was clear: A man’s fate mattered less than his reputation. The family’s honor rested with Watson now.', 'Typically, Navy inquiries are confidential, as with a grand jury in a criminal case. But the press demanded that they be allowed to watch, and Denby relented. As the inquiry got underway, its public nature seemed more than anything to dictate what would become of Watson and his commanders. No one wished to give any impression that mercy would be shown to the men behind the worst peacetime disaster in Navy history.', 'Watson and his commanders wouldn’t be allowed to testify; as they were possible defendants in court-martial proceedings, anything they said could expose them to prosecution. Only one senior crew member of the Delphy was called to testify: Laurence Blodgett, Hunter’s second-in-command. “We were satisfied that the Arguello radio station was wrong,” Blodgett explained from the stand. “They kept giving our position north and to the west of Point Arguello, and when we could not make this check with our figures, we finally took the reciprocal of their bearings, which would show us already in the Santa Barbara Channel.” As soon as he finished, the prosecutor asked to add Blodgett to the defendant list too. His role in making navigation decisions transformed him, in the eyes of the court, from a bystander to a suspect. Off the stand he went; the defense never had a chance to cross-examine him.', 'This was a search for scapegoats—but should the ships’ commanders have expected anything different? Watson at least was desperate to have his say. Just days after the worst possible thing that could have happened on his watch came to pass, he was staring down what he considered another disaster. The men under his command—the ones who’d followed his lead—were about to lose their reputations and livelihoods. This could be why, on the inquiry’s second day, Watson made his first public comments about Honda Point. “The responsibility for the course of the destroyer squadron was mine, a responsibility which I fully realized,” he told a reporter for a news service, whose story would appear in papers around the country in the days to come. “But that decision was based upon 33 years of experience in the Navy, and made after due consideration of reports of our position from the Point Arguello radio station, which were confusing.”', 'It was part mea culpa, part dogged display. Watson continued on like this, switching from accepting blame to explaining why, given the weather and the cryptic RDF readings, anyone in his position would have done the same thing. “The condition of visibility, remember, was such that we were unable to get our true position from the stars. We were compelled to rely upon the radio station. I asked for our bearings repeatedly. From about 6:30 until 8 o’clock p.m., that most vital period in our lives, we were unable to get radio bearings from the station. I accept that responsibility. I made a naval officer’s decision. I was content the radio station was wrong. And that is why I gave the order.”', 'On September 22, Watson issued a similar statement to the court of inquiry and to the press: “The Squadron Commander hopes the responsibility for this disaster, which he considers entirely his own, may not descend upon the able and loyal subordinates who supported him on all occasions.” Watson was sacrificing himself, throwing himself into the prosecution’s line of fire. He also asked the court to waive its rule barring potential defendants from testifying—in effect, making himself more vulnerable to court-martial so that he could have his say now.', 'The court granted Watson’s request, and he was permitted to take the stand on September 24. “The responsibility was mine,” he said. “I was convinced that the station was wrong. But they were right.”', 'The court of inquiry’s president, Rear Admiral William V. Pratt, attempted to pick apart this blanket admission. “Do you feel,” he asked Watson, “that you can assume all of the responsibility that at times must fall on the shoulders of your division commanders?”', '“I have no desire to assume their responsibilities,” Watson replied. “I simply want to make clear that I assume all of my own.”', 'Watson braced himself for a public flogging. So perhaps he was as surprised as anyone when the opposite occurred. Almost overnight, the squadron commander transformed—in the eyes of the public, at least—from the incompetent scion of a naval legend to a paragon of selflessness and sacrifice. More than one newspaper editorial used the word “manliness” to describe what he’d done.', '“Capt. Watson has given a splendid example of the finest attributes of character overcoming the elemental instinct of self-preservation,” the Army and Navy Journal declared, while the San Diego Sun waxed on about Watson’s “heroic” soul. “He waits for no court martial. He relies not on lawyers. He seeks no avenue of evasion. He resorts to no subterfuge. Lest the blame rest on some innocent man, he takes upon himself full responsibility for his actions.”', 'Others around the country joined the chorus, taking Watson’s testimony as their cue to examine what true leadership really meant. “The heroism of captain Watson is of a different type,” declared the Santa Monica Evening Gazette. “It manifests itself after deliberation; after the weighing of consequences.” And this from the San Francisco Chronicle: “From the moment the ship struck, his bearing and speech have been that of a most remarkable example of real manliness under the most distressing conditions which an officer in his position can ever meet.”', 'The goodwill seemed to play a part in Watson persuading the other officers named as defendants to join him in testifying, so that they also would have the chance to recount what had happened that night. This was no small thing: By opening themselves to prosecution, these officers had to have faith that Watson’s contrition would reflect well on them. Admiral Pratt called their decision to testify “worthy of the best traditions of the Navy.”\xa0', 'When the Delphy’s skipper, Hunter, testified, he also made sure to blame the technology, as Watson had. “I’ll have to admit that it was an error in judgment,” he testified. “But as contributing causes I believe … the fact that a bilateral radio compass is used there were partly responsible.” Hunter also floated the “possibility” that “abnormal currents caused by the Japanese earthquake” contributed to the problem. In response, the lieutenant commander in charge of the Point Arguello lighthouse took the stand, defending his compass bearings that night. In fact, the readings had been within a few degrees of accuracy the whole time, even if one of them had required a reciprocal adjustment.', 'Many of Watson’s other commanders said that they weren’t responsible for what had happened because they’d been duty-bound to follow the Delphy’s lead. The Navy’s sacred adherence to chain of command suddenly was on trial, too. Robert Morris, the commander of the division of ships immediately astern of the Delphy, said that they “could not possibly be held culpable in carrying out the destroyer doctrine of following their leader.” Rear Admiral Pratt asked Morris, “Does seniority take the place of common sense?” Morris replied, “They are supposed to be synonymous.”', 'Not every skipper had hewed so tightly to that edict. Thomas A. Symington of the Thompson, the last ship in line, said that once he’d noticed the confusion of lights and sirens ahead, he slowed down to take soundings. Leslie Bratton of the Stoddert said that he’d opted to violate the no-navigation order and asked the lighthouse for radio bearings himself, then steered his ship away in time to avoid disaster. Hardy B. Page, navigator of the Hamilton, said that he’d suspected there was a problem ahead and advised his commanding officer to get word to the division commander—a decision that helped the division’s three ships escape intact.', 'Finally, the board heard from Walter Roper—the division commander who a few hours before the disaster had jousted with Watson by radio about helping the Cuba. Roper was as flinty on the stand as he’d been that night on the water. “I’m not a desk man. My experience comes from hard knocks,” he said, a jab at Watson’s lack of experience and Hunter’s academy training. “There are too many book-learned and not enough practical men running the Navy.” In Roper’s view, those on the Delphy should never have assumed that the ship really was going 20 knots in such choppy water. The error, he said, was in putting “too much reliance on computation of speed by propeller revolutions.” In his experience, he said, he’d seen propellers indicate 20 knots when the ship was in fact going only 12.', 'Roper made a point of saying that he would have heeded the lighthouse. “I have gone into the most dangerous harbors in the world through impenetrable fogs, guided almost wholly by radio compass,” he said. His division had never turned left, he testified, because he never came close to trusting the Delphy. “I was positive we had not passed Point Arguello. I did not know the forward ships were turning. Could I have seen them, I would not have followed, but instead would have tried to stop them. My motto is ‘Never try to turn a corner until you have passed.’\u202f”', 'Rear Admiral Pratt asked Roper if he would have turned left had he been on the ship behind the Delphy. “Of course I would not,” Roper said. “\u202f‘Follow the leader’ is all right, but it should be tempered with common sense. When I was a boy, our leader once jumped off a barn. I stayed put—and walked down to pick him up. He had a broken leg.” The room erupted with laughter.', 'But the fact remained that Roper failed to speak up against Watson at the time. Had he been stinging from their quarrel over the Cuba? If he’d said something—one of many ifs that night—might the entire disaster have been avoided, and 23 lives spared?', 'On October 12, the court of inquiry made its determination. Never mind the weather and the radio; the Honda Point disaster, the court ruled, was the result of “bad errors and faulty navigation.” Faced with so much uncertainty, the ships should have slowed down to take depth soundings. Following the leader may have been a Navy tradition, but it shouldn’t trump reason.', 'Eleven officers were recommended for court-martial. Watson, Hunter, and Blodgett were charged with “culpable inefficiency and negligence,” and eight others with simple negligence. But the court seemed gripped by contradictory impulses. It issued a letter to Calhoun, the Young’s commander, commending him “for coolness, intelligence, and seamanlike ability,” and to Walter D. Seed, of the Fuller, for “great bravery in swimming … about seventy five yards, through a rough and turbulent sea … for the salvage of the crew.” Yet both also faced charges of negligence.', 'The court-martial proceedings took place in rapid succession during the month of November. All eyes remained on Watson. Would his penitence spare the others? On November 7, Watson doubled down with another public statement. “I am ready and anxious to take my medicine. I don’t want an acquittal. For me to be acquitted by this court would be bad for the naval service, to which both my father and myself have devoted our lives.”', 'Calhoun, at his trial, went out of his way to commend Watson. He testified that in his opinion no power on earth could have saved the Young and the other ships after the Delphy ran aground. Calhoun insisted that he had no reason to suspect the Delphy of any errors, and testified that he and the Young’s crew would not have done anything differently had they been at the front of the line—except perhaps take soundings.', 'Watson reciprocated as a witness at Calhoun’s trial. “Every man of the crew of the Young owes his life solely and entirely to Commander Calhoun,” he testified.', 'In his summation speech in Watson’s trial, Watson’s lawyer, Thomas T. Craven, noted how, at Honda Point, “fate was indeed stern upon this occasion.” If the Delphy had continued south for just a few more minutes before turning, the entire column of ships would have cleared the rocks. If they’d turned a few minutes sooner, the coast would have been more forgiving, resulting in less damage and fewer lives lost. How many Navy men, Craven asked, had made similarly small missteps and escaped the hand of fate? Watson, he suggested, was a victim of bad luck.', 'Calhoun was acquitted after 40 minutes of deliberation. Blodgett, the Delphy’s navigator, was also acquitted, as were seven other defendants. There were just two convictions:\xa0Edward Howe Watson and Donald T. Hunter would not escape official blame for what happened that night. But considering the scale of the catastrophe, their sentences were lighter than expected. Both Watson and Hunter were allowed to continue their military careers, but with lower ranking numbers, which virtually eliminated the possibility of promotion. Neither would command a ship again, but they would retain their ranks. And the careers of the other men would be saved.', '“It is a very proper sentence,” Watson told reporters. “It is a fitting punishment. The loss of a few numbers could not be a sufficient punishment for an error as great as mine was. I am glad that the sentence is as severe as it is. It puts me very near the bottom of the list of captains, I guess. Needless to say, it does not make me happy.”', 'Watson had transformed from a villain to a hero with his admission in September. Now, in December, with his career intact, things changed again. Back Watson went, from hero to goat. Yet, by taking the blame, had Watson—no matter how gallant the gesture—simply given the Navy a smooth path toward putting the embarrassing episode behind it? And was the Navy now rewarding Watson for his contrition? After the loss of seven ships and 23 lives, how was it exactly that not one member of the Navy had lost their job?', '“Just learned court-martial has been very lenient with everybody,” President Calvin Coolidge said. Navy Secretary Denby also made sure to grumble publicly that the “sentence in [Watson’s] case is inadequate.”', 'On December 29, the Army and Navy Journal reported, “The light sentence created almost as great a sensation at Washington as the disaster.”', 'Eugene Dooman’s escape from the scene at Honda Point occurred just before dawn after the wrecks, when a train to Los Angeles approached the local station where the relief efforts were headquartered. Watson told Dooman and a few others to board it. Hundreds of other men would be taking the San Diego train a few hours later. Dooman, like many in the squadron, was covered from head to foot with oil, so a conductor placed some newspapers on the seat, and off they went. In Los Angeles, Dooman was on his own again, delivered from the tragedy—and from the official narrative.', 'The available record from the court of inquiry and Watson’s court-martial includes just one mention of a civilian on the Delphy, but Dooman’s name never appears. In the years to come, as military and civilian historians researched the Honda Point disaster, the idea of a not-spoken-for witness to the disaster proved tantalizing. He was called the “mystery guest,” the “civilian,” the “phantom passenger.” Rumors circulated that he and Watson had been drinking that day (Watson and others denied this), or that Watson subsequently swore him to silence about what really went wrong that night. But while Dooman’s identity was never well publicized, it was never really secret either. In January 1924, he gave a long interview to an English-language paper in Japan, complimenting Watson’s performance on the night of the wreck and relating the tale of his own escape. Had the historians and writers seen that article, the mystery would have been solved.', 'After 30 years as a diplomat in Tokyo, Dooman came home to America after Pearl Harbor, retiring just a few years later, in 1945. It took until the 1960s for him to be located and asked about Honda Point. “I am not competent” to pass judgment on Watson’s decisions that day, he wrote one interlocutor in 1966. “That is to say, I cannot weigh the extenuating circumstances, but a disaster did occur and the man who made the decision had to assume responsibility.”', 'Dooman was asked why he was never called to testify in the inquiry, and what happened to the $3,000 in silver he’d brought on board. The answers, it turned out, were linked. The silver was sacrificed, Dooman wrote, in the name of discretion. The money had been found in the wreckage, he wrote, “but could not be claimed without the probability of being called as a witness in the court-martial, and Watson and his defense officer were afraid that my testimony might prove harmful to Watson, since I was with him when the ship struck.” By today’s standards, these actions would have constituted a cover-up. But every answer Dooman gave seemed to prompt more questions. Why had the Navy not asked him to testify? Did his job in the State Department play a part in that decision? Or was the Navy afraid that additional testimony from a civilian passenger would add yet more unwelcome intrigue to a debacle it wished would just go away?', 'Dooman wouldn’t say. But he and Watson remained friends for years. A few days after the disaster, Dooman explained, with the inquiry not yet begun, he’d paid a visit to Watson and his wife at their home in San Diego. (Some armchair historians, parsing the disaster’s themes of negligence and culpability, have gone so far as to wonder if the captain reimbursed Dooman his lost $3,000 in return for his discretion. If such a thing occurred, Dooman never mentioned it.) The Watsons would later visit Japan, in 1937, and dine with Dooman there. He curtly alluded to the price Watson paid for the tragedy, the toll it took on him. “After the disaster,” Dooman wrote, “he lost his zest for living and became very despondent.”', 'Just after the court-martial, Dooman wrote a letter to Watson, one of dozens sent by friends and well-wishers hoping to soften the blow. “Do you know what a splendid impression you have made on everybody,” the diplomat wrote from Washington, “not only those high in the Navy but the man in the street? I dined with Admiral Knight who said splendid things about you. I think you will appreciate even more, though, what I overheard in the cars the other day—‘Well,’ said one, ‘I don’t get this stuff about the compass, but as long as we have fellows in the Navy like this guy who took the blame we shouldn’t worry.’\u202f”', 'William Calhoun was cleared of any blame for the Young’s tragedy; he was even commended for his cool demeanor during the rescue. But the loss of 20 men weighed heavily on him, and for a time it seemed foolish to assume that Calhoun would command a ship again. Eventually, however, his career righted itself. After serving on several ships, further instruction at the Naval War College, and a stint as an instructor at the Naval Academy, Calhoun returned to sea as commanding officer of the USS Rochester, and later the USS California. In 1938, he was promoted to rear admiral. The next year, he became commander of the Navy’s Pacific base in Honolulu and remained in that position through World War II. “There was nothing the fleet wanted that Uncle Bill wouldn’t get,” one commander would say.', 'Calhoun retired in 1946 a four-star admiral, after 44 years of active service. There was just one thing missing from his time at sea: He never saw battle. For that he’d be granted some satisfaction from the author James A. Michener, who’d been a lieutenant commander under Calhoun during the war. “Those of us who worked for Uncle Billy believed that he had played a major role in smothering the Japanese with matériel,” Michener wrote in his memoirs, “and the fighting admirals agreed.” In Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific—the Pulitzer Prize–winning basis for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical—Calhoun is said to be the model for Millard Kester, a grounded admiral who finally gets to do battle at sea, leading an entire invasion force. And winning.', 'Calhoun died in 1963; he had married and was a grandfather many times over. In 1984, some 61 years after the disaster, a scuba diver and amateur treasure hunter exploring the California coast noticed something shiny on the ocean floor, churned up by a recent storm: a class ring from the Naval Academy. It didn’t take long to connect the ring to its deceased owner. The diver had hoped to make some money for a discovery from the site of the disaster. One collector offered him $1,500. Then a fellow diver let him know that Calhoun’s widow, Rosalie, was alive and living in Coronado, near San Diego. Her phone number was listed. He agreed to sell the ring to her for $400—the cost of the dive, he said.', 'Rosalie had never remarried. The ring, when the diver handed it over, stirred something in her. “It’s like part of him was brought back,” she said, filled with emotion for her lost husband.', 'On December 14, 1923, six days after Edward Howe Watson’s conviction in a Navy court-martial, his father, retired admiral John Crittenden Watson, died at 81. A fellow retired admiral, Colby M. Chester, wrote to the younger Watson that same day: “Your name was the last one uttered by your father, and I know how happy the Honda affair made him.” Happy that\xa0his son’s career was intact, perhaps. Or that the family name had, despite everything, retained some of its dignity.\xa0', 'On January 10, 1924, Watson along with his wife and daughter moved to Honolulu, where he was stationed until his retirement five years later. In the 1930s, the Watsons lived in New York and then in Jamestown, Rhode Island, visiting Japan several times. In the years before World War II, Watson indulged his fascination with Japan, writing poems about historic Japanese figures. That other existence he might have led before Honda Point—the life of a sly and insightful Navy attaché, drawing out spies and supplying Washington with essential information about a potentially lethal foe—seemed to loom large for him.', 'In the late 1930s, Watson drafted a long policy memo about Japan to a friend at the Naval War College, still hoping someone would heed his warnings—“stuff that I have worked up during the past 5 years, since my retirement,” as he described it. “Perhaps it will help to save many hours to some fellow who is doing a bit of research work on the subject. Dispose of it as your judgment dictates. Either in the files or by burning.”', 'Watson died of heart disease in a Navy hospital on January 7, 1942, a month to the day after Pearl Harbor proved his point. His family later said that they thought the attack had hastened his death. Honda Point was not mentioned in any of his published obituaries.', 'Watson had pursued a life of significance, of honor. At Honda Point, the son emulated the father, following the traditions of leadership codified by an entire generation—and those same traditions contributed to the disaster. But after the worst happened, and the nation had judged him, he chose to preserve his character. In doing so, he acquired a different kind of significance, one he hadn’t expected.', 'In his papers, there is a letter from Watson’s father written on October 1, 1923, just after Watson had publicly accepted responsibility for the error that cost the Navy seven ships and 23 lives. In its tone, the letter was far warmer and more effusive than the one that had preceded it. “I cannot express in any words how proud we are of you and of your devoted wife,” the father wrote.', 'In the letter, Watson’s father offered his son a gift. He said that a relative of the late Admiral David Farragut had written to him “to express his confidence in you,” and sent along a precious keepsake: a makeshift tourniquet the elder Watson had made aboard the Hartford during the Civil War, “just as we were about to pass up the Mississippi by the Confederate batteries.”', 'Farragut had given this rag—a relic of John Crittenden’s most glorious moment in the Navy—to his own son “to use in case of a wound.” Now it seemed that someone else had a better use for it. “When I wrote him I know you would love to have it, he sent it to me,” Watson’s father wrote. “I will hold it for you until you come East. All of us join in ever much love to all three of you.”', 'And so Edward Howe Watson was offered a tourniquet—a message from father to son. His son was wounded and needed care. His son was worthy of greatness. His son was a Watson. And in court his son had not shirked from his duty to do what the father never had to do: go down with his ship.', '© 2023 The Atavist Magazine.

Finally, someone decided not to wait any longer. Peterson, the chief boatswain’s mate, had planned to swim for the rock between the Young and the shore before the Chauncey arrived. Now he was ready to swim to the Chauncey.', 'Peterson took three lengths of line totaling more than 100 yards, found a doughnut-shaped buoy, fastened the line to it, and slipped the buoy over his head. On Calhoun’s order, he dove into the frigid water and made it to the Chauncey in a matter of minutes. A crew member recalled hearing Calhoun shout that a swimmer was coming their way. Once Peterson had been lifted aboard the Chauncey, Herzinger followed using Peterson’s line. “Had he lost his hold,” Calhoun recalled, “he would have been in fuel oil and an angry sea, and would undoubtedly have lost his life.”', 'After Herzinger made it across, the Chauncey sent back a seven-man raft. Evacuations commenced—four men on the first raft, eight on the second, ten on the others. It took 11 crossings to get everyone who could be found off the Young. Calhoun made one last inspection before boarding the final raft. “I want to state that Providence put the Chauncey ashore in that place,” Calhoun later said. “It is absolutely certain in my mind that the loss of the Chauncey saved half of the crew of my ship or more.”', 'There was one additional consolation: Fireman Scott, who had volunteered to shut down the Young’s boiler, finally reappeared at about 10:30 p.m., when the lighthouse keepers on shore heard cries for help from the bottom of the bluffs—five surviving sailors, including Scott. He’d made it off the Young and into the water but was unconscious, and when he awoke he clung to a piece of flotsam; he’d floated for an hour before being hauled aboard a raft.', 'Calhoun knew that not everyone from his ship had made it. He wondered how many still flailed in the oil-coated water. And the engine- and fire-room crews deep inside the ship: had they been trapped down below, or were they pulled out by the undertow as the ship rolled? Those men—his men—had been 150 yards from shore with no way out of the ship.', 'On shore, when Herzinger mentioned to Calhoun that the losses were great, as many as 20 or 30 sailors, the young captain’s response was grave: “My God, I know—but we will not discuss it now.”', 'The rescue efforts were just getting underway as the remaining ships neared Honda Point, still following the leader. For some it was too late to change course. One after another, they smashed into the shore—a seven-ship pileup on the California coast—hitting rocks, reefs, and, in some cases, one another.', 'The officers of the Woodbury saw lights ahead of the other ships and assumed a man was overboard. They reversed engines, but not soon enough to avoid ramming a large boulder.', 'The Nicholas struck a reef, and the pounding surf spun the boat until it pointed out to sea. The oil, the rocks, and the darkness made lowering rafts impossible; the men had to wait all night for a lifeline from shore.', 'Then came the Farragut, named for the great Civil War hero. Lieutenant Commander J. F. McClain ordered a full stop, but reversing the engines doused the ship’s lights. Suddenly, it was dark again, and the Fuller, next in the squadron line, collided with the Farragut before hitting a pinnacle rock—the same one that had claimed the Woodbury.', 'The ships at the back of Watson’s column, the Percival and the Somers, had time and space enough to change course. The last division—the Paul Hamilton, the Stoddert, and the Thompson—never took the turn into the channel.', 'Along the shore, an entire community was mobilizing to help rescue the sailors still in the water. The ships’ sirens had woken nearby residents, who loaded their cars with blankets, hot coffee, and food, and rushed to the steep bluff. A fishing captain, Giacomo Noceti, bravely ferried his boat to the edge of the rocks and retrieved some 150 men with lines. A nearby rail station became a headquarters for relief workers, who brought aid in and shipped rescued sailors out. A passing train took the injured to Santa Barbara hospitals, and later that day another transported 38 officers and 517 enlisted men to the naval base in San Diego.', 'The Delphy snapped in two just five minutes after everyone except Pearson had evacuated. The ship’s searchlight tower leaned farther over with each barrage of waves, until it dragged the rest of the ship over and down. The section of the deck where Pearson had been tied up was pulled into the ocean. He was one of the Delphy’s three casualties that night.', 'How many were lost from the rest of the fleet wouldn’t be known for hours. Through it all, Watson checked on the injured, organized search parties, tallied his men, and reported back to naval headquarters. By morning, he was preparing to send salvage parties back to the ships and arranging for the care of survivors. Even Calhoun, grappling with unspeakable losses, would later praise the commander, stating, “I only hope that if ever I am faced with the tragedy that faced him that night, I’ll be half the man that he was: cool, calm, courageous, and thoughtful; never missing an opportunity to aid.” But in idle moments, alone with his thoughts, Watson seemed to Dooman years older.', 'When a search party returned with the body of Fireman Conway, who had fallen from a rescue line into the water, Watson approached the stretcher. He raised the blanket and looked down on Conway for a long moment. Then, silently, the captain unbuckled the sword he wore and laid it beside the body.', 'Was he thinking about all the men—some 300 or so, as he estimated early on—who might be dead because of the decision he’d signed off on?', 'Was he thinking about his friend Dooman, there only because of his invitation? Or his daughter, who’d been promised a spot, and how lucky it was she hadn’t been aboard?', 'Was he thinking about his wider family? His father and the legacy of the Watsons, that night on the Hartford in 1864 and Captain Farragut’s cry of “Damn the torpedoes!”? Did he sense any connection between that historic moment and his decision to push forward at all costs?', 'There would be time for him to mull these questions—to sift through everything that had happened—later on that night, in the weeks and months to come, and for the rest of his life.', '3.', 'In the space of just ten minutes, the Navy lost more ships than it had during all of World War I. Seven destroyers ran aground, one after another, each with more than 100 men aboard. Some of them split in two on the rocks. They collided with one another. They hemorrhaged oil—some 300,000 gallons covering 800 acres.', 'Twenty-three sailors lost their lives: three on the Delphy, twenty on the Young. A miracle by some measures, a debacle by others. Of the men trapped inside the Young, most probably fought through smoke and gas, darkness and freezing water. None made it to shore. Those who didn’t drown immediately were caught in the ebbing tide and sucked out to sea.', 'The disaster was front-page news around the country. Some 10,000 people turned up for a memorial service in San Diego. A week later, hundreds of visitors from Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, and other nearby towns flocked to the cliffs above Honda Point to view the wreckage. Demand to visit the scene was so high that a special train was provided on Sunday. Many packed a lunch and remained on the bluffs all day.', 'The day after the disaster, Navy secretary Edwin Denby seized on the great Kanto earthquake as the explanation. It was because of the quake, he suggested—an act of God, with unthinkable ramifications an ocean away—that nothing went as planned on the water that day. It explained why the ships never really reached 20 knots. Usually, the current pushed ships south; on that day it pushed them north. “One of the destroyers was broken in two, and it seems as if she was carried bodily up and dropped,” Denby marveled.', 'Others blamed technology: that infuriating RDF, sending good sailors astray, undermining their expertise. “The theory was advanced by mariners,” The Washington Post reported, “that the compass bearings taken from a nearby shore station as guidance through the fog, had been transmitted erroneously.”', 'Yet to some the weather and the obscure compass readings only explained so much. The Navy scheduled an inquiry for Monday, September 17. Depending on the outcome, the next step could involve court-martials. That left a week for the press to point fingers. “There has been a peculiar reluctance on the part of officers responsible for full and prompt reports of what happened,” a New York Times editorial declared. “For the honor of the United States Navy and for the good of the service those who were responsible should be made to suffer for it.”', 'Among those who might bear responsibility, Watson was an ideal target. Not only had he been the one in charge, but he offered a newspaper-ready narrative: an admiral’s son, wealthy and connected, now facing utter disgrace. Watson and the ship commanders hunkered in San Diego, awaiting the inquiry in silence. Those close to Watson encouraged him to try and stop what was coming. His brother Loyall urged him to stand firm and defend himself. His brother-in-law, Clifford Gratz, wanted to leverage his family’s relationship with the Rockefellers to spare Watson and help stave off any embarrassment to the family. Naval Academy friends worked back channels, pleading for leniency.\xa0', 'But there was one person whose opinion mattered more than any other. On September 16, retired rear admiral John Crittenden Watson, then 80 and in fragile health, wrote to his son from his home in Washington, D.C. “I knew the saving of all the lives possible would be the greatest comfort to you and our dear Hermine,” the elder Watson wrote. “Like both of you, our thought is that you were able to save not only your own life but to assist others.”', 'With its measured tone, the admiral’s letter spoke volumes. There was no assurance of his son’s guiltlessness—no proclamation that, faced with the day’s beguiling circumstances, he would have acted the same. The message was clear: A man’s fate mattered less than his reputation. The family’s honor rested with Watson now.', 'Typically, Navy inquiries are confidential, as with a grand jury in a criminal case. But the press demanded that they be allowed to watch, and Denby relented. As the inquiry got underway, its public nature seemed more than anything to dictate what would become of Watson and his commanders. No one wished to give any impression that mercy would be shown to the men behind the worst peacetime disaster in Navy history.', 'Watson and his commanders wouldn’t be allowed to testify; as they were possible defendants in court-martial proceedings, anything they said could expose them to prosecution. Only one senior crew member of the Delphy was called to testify: Laurence Blodgett, Hunter’s second-in-command. “We were satisfied that the Arguello radio station was wrong,” Blodgett explained from the stand. “They kept giving our position north and to the west of Point Arguello, and when we could not make this check with our figures, we finally took the reciprocal of their bearings, which would show us already in the Santa Barbara Channel.” As soon as he finished, the prosecutor asked to add Blodgett to the defendant list too. His role in making navigation decisions transformed him, in the eyes of the court, from a bystander to a suspect. Off the stand he went; the defense never had a chance to cross-examine him.', 'This was a search for scapegoats—but should the ships’ commanders have expected anything different? Watson at least was desperate to have his say. Just days after the worst possible thing that could have happened on his watch came to pass, he was staring down what he considered another disaster. The men under his command—the ones who’d followed his lead—were about to lose their reputations and livelihoods. This could be why, on the inquiry’s second day, Watson made his first public comments about Honda Point. “The responsibility for the course of the destroyer squadron was mine, a responsibility which I fully realized,” he told a reporter for a news service, whose story would appear in papers around the country in the days to come. “But that decision was based upon 33 years of experience in the Navy, and made after due consideration of reports of our position from the Point Arguello radio station, which were confusing.”', 'It was part mea culpa, part dogged display. Watson continued on like this, switching from accepting blame to explaining why, given the weather and the cryptic RDF readings, anyone in his position would have done the same thing. “The condition of visibility, remember, was such that we were unable to get our true position from the stars. We were compelled to rely upon the radio station. I asked for our bearings repeatedly. From about 6:30 until 8 o’clock p.m., that most vital period in our lives, we were unable to get radio bearings from the station. I accept that responsibility. I made a naval officer’s decision. I was content the radio station was wrong. And that is why I gave the order.”', 'On September 22, Watson issued a similar statement to the court of inquiry and to the press: “The Squadron Commander hopes the responsibility for this disaster, which he considers entirely his own, may not descend upon the able and loyal subordinates who supported him on all occasions.” Watson was sacrificing himself, throwing himself into the prosecution’s line of fire. He also asked the court to waive its rule barring potential defendants from testifying—in effect, making himself more vulnerable to court-martial so that he could have his say now.', 'The court granted Watson’s request, and he was permitted to take the stand on September 24. “The responsibility was mine,” he said. “I was convinced that the station was wrong. But they were right.”', 'The court of inquiry’s president, Rear Admiral William V. Pratt, attempted to pick apart this blanket admission. “Do you feel,” he asked Watson, “that you can assume all of the responsibility that at times must fall on the shoulders of your division commanders?”', '“I have no desire to assume their responsibilities,” Watson replied. “I simply want to make clear that I assume all of my own.”', 'Watson braced himself for a public flogging. So perhaps he was as surprised as anyone when the opposite occurred. Almost overnight, the squadron commander transformed—in the eyes of the public, at least—from the incompetent scion of a naval legend to a paragon of selflessness and sacrifice. More than one newspaper editorial used the word “manliness” to describe what he’d done.', '“Capt. Watson has given a splendid example of the finest attributes of character overcoming the elemental instinct of self-preservation,” the Army and Navy Journal declared, while the San Diego Sun waxed on about Watson’s “heroic” soul. “He waits for no court martial. He relies not on lawyers. He seeks no avenue of evasion. He resorts to no subterfuge. Lest the blame rest on some innocent man, he takes upon himself full responsibility for his actions.”', 'Others around the country joined the chorus, taking Watson’s testimony as their cue to examine what true leadership really meant. “The heroism of captain Watson is of a different type,” declared the Santa Monica Evening Gazette. “It manifests itself after deliberation; after the weighing of consequences.” And this from the San Francisco Chronicle: “From the moment the ship struck, his bearing and speech have been that of a most remarkable example of real manliness under the most distressing conditions which an officer in his position can ever meet.”', 'The goodwill seemed to play a part in Watson persuading the other officers named as defendants to join him in testifying, so that they also would have the chance to recount what had happened that night. This was no small thing: By opening themselves to prosecution, these officers had to have faith that Watson’s contrition would reflect well on them. Admiral Pratt called their decision to testify “worthy of the best traditions of the Navy.”\xa0', 'When the Delphy’s skipper, Hunter, testified, he also made sure to blame the technology, as Watson had. “I’ll have to admit that it was an error in judgment,” he testified. “But as contributing causes I believe … the fact that a bilateral radio compass is used there were partly responsible.” Hunter also floated the “possibility” that “abnormal currents caused by the Japanese earthquake” contributed to the problem. In response, the lieutenant commander in charge of the Point Arguello lighthouse took the stand, defending his compass bearings that night. In fact, the readings had been within a few degrees of accuracy the whole time, even if one of them had required a reciprocal adjustment.', 'Many of Watson’s other commanders said that they weren’t responsible for what had happened because they’d been duty-bound to follow the Delphy’s lead. The Navy’s sacred adherence to chain of command suddenly was on trial, too. Robert Morris, the commander of the division of ships immediately astern of the Delphy, said that they “could not possibly be held culpable in carrying out the destroyer doctrine of following their leader.” Rear Admiral Pratt asked Morris, “Does seniority take the place of common sense?” Morris replied, “They are supposed to be synonymous.”', 'Not every skipper had hewed so tightly to that edict. Thomas A. Symington of the Thompson, the last ship in line, said that once he’d noticed the confusion of lights and sirens ahead, he slowed down to take soundings. Leslie Bratton of the Stoddert said that he’d opted to violate the no-navigation order and asked the lighthouse for radio bearings himself, then steered his ship away in time to avoid disaster. Hardy B. Page, navigator of the Hamilton, said that he’d suspected there was a problem ahead and advised his commanding officer to get word to the division commander—a decision that helped the division’s three ships escape intact.', 'Finally, the board heard from Walter Roper—the division commander who a few hours before the disaster had jousted with Watson by radio about helping the Cuba. Roper was as flinty on the stand as he’d been that night on the water. “I’m not a desk man. My experience comes from hard knocks,” he said, a jab at Watson’s lack of experience and Hunter’s academy training. “There are too many book-learned and not enough practical men running the Navy.” In Roper’s view, those on the Delphy should never have assumed that the ship really was going 20 knots in such choppy water. The error, he said, was in putting “too much reliance on computation of speed by propeller revolutions.” In his experience, he said, he’d seen propellers indicate 20 knots when the ship was in fact going only 12.', 'Roper made a point of saying that he would have heeded the lighthouse. “I have gone into the most dangerous harbors in the world through impenetrable fogs, guided almost wholly by radio compass,” he said. His division had never turned left, he testified, because he never came close to trusting the Delphy. “I was positive we had not passed Point Arguello. I did not know the forward ships were turning. Could I have seen them, I would not have followed, but instead would have tried to stop them. My motto is ‘Never try to turn a corner until you have passed.’\u202f”', 'Rear Admiral Pratt asked Roper if he would have turned left had he been on the ship behind the Delphy. “Of course I would not,” Roper said. “\u202f‘Follow the leader’ is all right, but it should be tempered with common sense. When I was a boy, our leader once jumped off a barn. I stayed put—and walked down to pick him up. He had a broken leg.” The room erupted with laughter.', 'But the fact remained that Roper failed to speak up against Watson at the time. Had he been stinging from their quarrel over the Cuba? If he’d said something—one of many ifs that night—might the entire disaster have been avoided, and 23 lives spared?', 'On October 12, the court of inquiry made its determination. Never mind the weather and the radio; the Honda Point disaster, the court ruled, was the result of “bad errors and faulty navigation.” Faced with so much uncertainty, the ships should have slowed down to take depth soundings. Following the leader may have been a Navy tradition, but it shouldn’t trump reason.', 'Eleven officers were recommended for court-martial. Watson, Hunter, and Blodgett were charged with “culpable inefficiency and negligence,” and eight others with simple negligence. But the court seemed gripped by contradictory impulses. It issued a letter to Calhoun, the Young’s commander, commending him “for coolness, intelligence, and seamanlike ability,” and to Walter D. Seed, of the Fuller, for “great bravery in swimming … about seventy five yards, through a rough and turbulent sea … for the salvage of the crew.” Yet both also faced charges of negligence.', 'The court-martial proceedings took place in rapid succession during the month of November. All eyes remained on Watson. Would his penitence spare the others? On November 7, Watson doubled down with another public statement. “I am ready and anxious to take my medicine. I don’t want an acquittal. For me to be acquitted by this court would be bad for the naval service, to which both my father and myself have devoted our lives.”', 'Calhoun, at his trial, went out of his way to commend Watson. He testified that in his opinion no power on earth could have saved the Young and the other ships after the Delphy ran aground. Calhoun insisted that he had no reason to suspect the Delphy of any errors, and testified that he and the Young’s crew would not have done anything differently had they been at the front of the line—except perhaps take soundings.', 'Watson reciprocated as a witness at Calhoun’s trial. “Every man of the crew of the Young owes his life solely and entirely to Commander Calhoun,” he testified.', 'In his summation speech in Watson’s trial, Watson’s lawyer, Thomas T. Craven, noted how, at Honda Point, “fate was indeed stern upon this occasion.” If the Delphy had continued south for just a few more minutes before turning, the entire column of ships would have cleared the rocks. If they’d turned a few minutes sooner, the coast would have been more forgiving, resulting in less damage and fewer lives lost. How many Navy men, Craven asked, had made similarly small missteps and escaped the hand of fate? Watson, he suggested, was a victim of bad luck.', 'Calhoun was acquitted after 40 minutes of deliberation. Blodgett, the Delphy’s navigator, was also acquitted, as were seven other defendants. There were just two convictions:\xa0Edward Howe Watson and Donald T. Hunter would not escape official blame for what happened that night. But considering the scale of the catastrophe, their sentences were lighter than expected. Both Watson and Hunter were allowed to continue their military careers, but with lower ranking numbers, which virtually eliminated the possibility of promotion. Neither would command a ship again, but they would retain their ranks. And the careers of the other men would be saved.', '“It is a very proper sentence,” Watson told reporters. “It is a fitting punishment. The loss of a few numbers could not be a sufficient punishment for an error as great as mine was. I am glad that the sentence is as severe as it is. It puts me very near the bottom of the list of captains, I guess. Needless to say, it does not make me happy.”', 'Watson had transformed from a villain to a hero with his admission in September. Now, in December, with his career intact, things changed again. Back Watson went, from hero to goat. Yet, by taking the blame, had Watson—no matter how gallant the gesture—simply given the Navy a smooth path toward putting the embarrassing episode behind it? And was the Navy now rewarding Watson for his contrition? After the loss of seven ships and 23 lives, how was it exactly that not one member of the Navy had lost their job?', '“Just learned court-martial has been very lenient with everybody,” President Calvin Coolidge said. Navy Secretary Denby also made sure to grumble publicly that the “sentence in [Watson’s] case is inadequate.”', 'On December 29, the Army and Navy Journal reported, “The light sentence created almost as great a sensation at Washington as the disaster.”', 'Eugene Dooman’s escape from the scene at Honda Point occurred just before dawn after the wrecks, when a train to Los Angeles approached the local station where the relief efforts were headquartered. Watson told Dooman and a few others to board it. Hundreds of other men would be taking the San Diego train a few hours later. Dooman, like many in the squadron, was covered from head to foot with oil, so a conductor placed some newspapers on the seat, and off they went. In Los Angeles, Dooman was on his own again, delivered from the tragedy—and from the official narrative.', 'The available record from the court of inquiry and Watson’s court-martial includes just one mention of a civilian on the Delphy, but Dooman’s name never appears. In the years to come, as military and civilian historians researched the Honda Point disaster, the idea of a not-spoken-for witness to the disaster proved tantalizing. He was called the “mystery guest,” the “civilian,” the “phantom passenger.” Rumors circulated that he and Watson had been drinking that day (Watson and others denied this), or that Watson subsequently swore him to silence about what really went wrong that night. But while Dooman’s identity was never well publicized, it was never really secret either. In January 1924, he gave a long interview to an English-language paper in Japan, complimenting Watson’s performance on the night of the wreck and relating the tale of his own escape. Had the historians and writers seen that article, the mystery would have been solved.', 'After 30 years as a diplomat in Tokyo, Dooman came home to America after Pearl Harbor, retiring just a few years later, in 1945. It took until the 1960s for him to be located and asked about Honda Point. “I am not competent” to pass judgment on Watson’s decisions that day, he wrote one interlocutor in 1966. “That is to say, I cannot weigh the extenuating circumstances, but a disaster did occur and the man who made the decision had to assume responsibility.”', 'Dooman was asked why he was never called to testify in the inquiry, and what happened to the $3,000 in silver he’d brought on board. The answers, it turned out, were linked. The silver was sacrificed, Dooman wrote, in the name of discretion. The money had been found in the wreckage, he wrote, “but could not be claimed without the probability of being called as a witness in the court-martial, and Watson and his defense officer were afraid that my testimony might prove harmful to Watson, since I was with him when the ship struck.” By today’s standards, these actions would have constituted a cover-up. But every answer Dooman gave seemed to prompt more questions. Why had the Navy not asked him to testify? Did his job in the State Department play a part in that decision? Or was the Navy afraid that additional testimony from a civilian passenger would add yet more unwelcome intrigue to a debacle it wished would just go away?', 'Dooman wouldn’t say. But he and Watson remained friends for years. A few days after the disaster, Dooman explained, with the inquiry not yet begun, he’d paid a visit to Watson and his wife at their home in San Diego. (Some armchair historians, parsing the disaster’s themes of negligence and culpability, have gone so far as to wonder if the captain reimbursed Dooman his lost $3,000 in return for his discretion. If such a thing occurred, Dooman never mentioned it.) The Watsons would later visit Japan, in 1937, and dine with Dooman there. He curtly alluded to the price Watson paid for the tragedy, the toll it took on him. “After the disaster,” Dooman wrote, “he lost his zest for living and became very despondent.”', 'Just after the court-martial, Dooman wrote a letter to Watson, one of dozens sent by friends and well-wishers hoping to soften the blow. “Do you know what a splendid impression you have made on everybody,” the diplomat wrote from Washington, “not only those high in the Navy but the man in the street? I dined with Admiral Knight who said splendid things about you. I think you will appreciate even more, though, what I overheard in the cars the other day—‘Well,’ said one, ‘I don’t get this stuff about the compass, but as long as we have fellows in the Navy like this guy who took the blame we shouldn’t worry.’\u202f”', 'William Calhoun was cleared of any blame for the Young’s tragedy; he was even commended for his cool demeanor during the rescue. But the loss of 20 men weighed heavily on him, and for a time it seemed foolish to assume that Calhoun would command a ship again. Eventually, however, his career righted itself. After serving on several ships, further instruction at the Naval War College, and a stint as an instructor at the Naval Academy, Calhoun returned to sea as commanding officer of the USS Rochester, and later the USS California. In 1938, he was promoted to rear admiral. The next year, he became commander of the Navy’s Pacific base in Honolulu and remained in that position through World War II. “There was nothing the fleet wanted that Uncle Bill wouldn’t get,” one commander would say.', 'Calhoun retired in 1946 a four-star admiral, after 44 years of active service. There was just one thing missing from his time at sea: He never saw battle. For that he’d be granted some satisfaction from the author James A. Michener, who’d been a lieutenant commander under Calhoun during the war. “Those of us who worked for Uncle Billy believed that he had played a major role in smothering the Japanese with matériel,” Michener wrote in his memoirs, “and the fighting admirals agreed.” In Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific—the Pulitzer Prize–winning basis for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical—Calhoun is said to be the model for Millard Kester, a grounded admiral who finally gets to do battle at sea, leading an entire invasion force. And winning.', 'Calhoun died in 1963; he had married and was a grandfather many times over. In 1984, some 61 years after the disaster, a scuba diver and amateur treasure hunter exploring the California coast noticed something shiny on the ocean floor, churned up by a recent storm: a class ring from the Naval Academy. It didn’t take long to connect the ring to its deceased owner. The diver had hoped to make some money for a discovery from the site of the disaster. One collector offered him $1,500. Then a fellow diver let him know that Calhoun’s widow, Rosalie, was alive and living in Coronado, near San Diego. Her phone number was listed. He agreed to sell the ring to her for $400—the cost of the dive, he said.', 'Rosalie had never remarried. The ring, when the diver handed it over, stirred something in her. “It’s like part of him was brought back,” she said, filled with emotion for her lost husband.', 'On December 14, 1923, six days after Edward Howe Watson’s conviction in a Navy court-martial, his father, retired admiral John Crittenden Watson, died at 81. A fellow retired admiral, Colby M. Chester, wrote to the younger Watson that same day: “Your name was the last one uttered by your father, and I know how happy the Honda affair made him.” Happy that\xa0his son’s career was intact, perhaps. Or that the family name had, despite everything, retained some of its dignity.\xa0', 'On January 10, 1924, Watson along with his wife and daughter moved to Honolulu, where he was stationed until his retirement five years later. In the 1930s, the Watsons lived in New York and then in Jamestown, Rhode Island, visiting Japan several times. In the years before World War II, Watson indulged his fascination with Japan, writing poems about historic Japanese figures. That other existence he might have led before Honda Point—the life of a sly and insightful Navy attaché, drawing out spies and supplying Washington with essential information about a potentially lethal foe—seemed to loom large for him.', 'In the late 1930s, Watson drafted a long policy memo about Japan to a friend at the Naval War College, still hoping someone would heed his warnings—“stuff that I have worked up during the past 5 years, since my retirement,” as he described it. “Perhaps it will help to save many hours to some fellow who is doing a bit of research work on the subject. Dispose of it as your judgment dictates. Either in the files or by burning.”', 'Watson died of heart disease in a Navy hospital on January 7, 1942, a month to the day after Pearl Harbor proved his point. His family later said that they thought the attack had hastened his death. Honda Point was not mentioned in any of his published obituaries.', 'Watson had pursued a life of significance, of honor. At Honda Point, the son emulated the father, following the traditions of leadership codified by an entire generation—and those same traditions contributed to the disaster. But after the worst happened, and the nation had judged him, he chose to preserve his character. In doing so, he acquired a different kind of significance, one he hadn’t expected.', 'In his papers, there is a letter from Watson’s father written on October 1, 1923, just after Watson had publicly accepted responsibility for the error that cost the Navy seven ships and 23 lives. In its tone, the letter was far warmer and more effusive than the one that had preceded it. “I cannot express in any words how proud we are of you and of your devoted wife,” the father wrote.', 'In the letter, Watson’s father offered his son a gift. He said that a relative of the late Admiral David Farragut had written to him “to express his confidence in you,” and sent along a precious keepsake: a makeshift tourniquet the elder Watson had made aboard the Hartford during the Civil War, “just as we were about to pass up the Mississippi by the Confederate batteries.”', 'Farragut had given this rag—a relic of John Crittenden’s most glorious moment in the Navy—to his own son “to use in case of a wound.” Now it seemed that someone else had a better use for it. “When I wrote him I know you would love to have it, he sent it to me,” Watson’s father wrote. “I will hold it for you until you come East. All of us join in ever much love to all three of you.”', 'And so Edward Howe Watson was offered a tourniquet—a message from father to son. His son was wounded and needed care. His son was worthy of greatness. His son was a Watson. And in court his son had not shirked from his duty to do what the father never had to do: go down with his ship.', '© 2023 The Atavist Magazine.

Only one senior crew member of the Delphy was called to testify: Laurence Blodgett, Hunter’s second-in-command. “We were satisfied that the Arguello radio station was wrong,” Blodgett explained from the stand. “They kept giving our position north and to the west of Point Arguello, and when we could not make this check with our figures, we finally took the reciprocal of their bearings, which would show us already in the Santa Barbara Channel.” As soon as he finished, the prosecutor asked to add Blodgett to the defendant list too.

Off the stand he went; the defense never had a chance to cross-examine him.', 'This was a search for scapegoats—but should the ships’ commanders have expected anything different? Watson at least was desperate to have his say. Just days after the worst possible thing that could have happened on his watch came to pass, he was staring down what he considered another disaster. The men under his command—the ones who’d followed his lead—were about to lose their reputations and livelihoods. This could be why, on the inquiry’s second day, Watson made his first public comments about Honda Point. “The responsibility for the course of the destroyer squadron was mine, a responsibility which I fully realized,” he told a reporter for a news service, whose story would appear in papers around the country in the days to come. “But that decision was based upon 33 years of experience in the Navy, and made after due consideration of reports of our position from the Point Arguello radio station, which were confusing.”', 'It was part mea culpa, part dogged display. Watson continued on like this, switching from accepting blame to explaining why, given the weather and the cryptic RDF readings, anyone in his position would have done the same thing. “The condition of visibility, remember, was such that we were unable to get our true position from the stars. We were compelled to rely upon the radio station. I asked for our bearings repeatedly. From about 6:30 until 8 o’clock p.m., that most vital period in our lives, we were unable to get radio bearings from the station. I accept that responsibility. I made a naval officer’s decision. I was content the radio station was wrong. And that is why I gave the order.”', 'On September 22, Watson issued a similar statement to the court of inquiry and to the press: “The Squadron Commander hopes the responsibility for this disaster, which he considers entirely his own, may not descend upon the able and loyal subordinates who supported him on all occasions.” Watson was sacrificing himself, throwing himself into the prosecution’s line of fire. He also asked the court to waive its rule barring potential defendants from testifying—in effect, making himself more vulnerable to court-martial so that he could have his say now.', 'The court granted Watson’s request, and he was permitted to take the stand on September 24. “The responsibility was mine,” he said. “I was convinced that the station was wrong. But they were right.”', 'The court of inquiry’s president, Rear Admiral William V. Pratt, attempted to pick apart this blanket admission. “Do you feel,” he asked Watson, “that you can assume all of the responsibility that at times must fall on the shoulders of your division commanders?”', '“I have no desire to assume their responsibilities,” Watson replied. “I simply want to make clear that I assume all of my own.”', 'Watson braced himself for a public flogging. So perhaps he was as surprised as anyone when the opposite occurred. Almost overnight, the squadron commander transformed—in the eyes of the public, at least—from the incompetent scion of a naval legend to a paragon of selflessness and sacrifice. More than one newspaper editorial used the word “manliness” to describe what he’d done.', '“Capt. Watson has given a splendid example of the finest attributes of character overcoming the elemental instinct of self-preservation,” the Army and Navy Journal declared, while the San Diego Sun waxed on about Watson’s “heroic” soul. “He waits for no court martial. He relies not on lawyers. He seeks no avenue of evasion. He resorts to no subterfuge. Lest the blame rest on some innocent man, he takes upon himself full responsibility for his actions.”', 'Others around the country joined the chorus, taking Watson’s testimony as their cue to examine what true leadership really meant. “The heroism of captain Watson is of a different type,” declared the Santa Monica Evening Gazette. “It manifests itself after deliberation; after the weighing of consequences.” And this from the San Francisco Chronicle: “From the moment the ship struck, his bearing and speech have been that of a most remarkable example of real manliness under the most distressing conditions which an officer in his position can ever meet.”', 'The goodwill seemed to play a part in Watson persuading the other officers named as defendants to join him in testifying, so that they also would have the chance to recount what had happened that night. This was no small thing: By opening themselves to prosecution, these officers had to have faith that Watson’s contrition would reflect well on them. Admiral Pratt called their decision to testify “worthy of the best traditions of the Navy.”\xa0', 'When the Delphy’s skipper, Hunter, testified, he also made sure to blame the technology, as Watson had. “I’ll have to admit that it was an error in judgment,” he testified. “But as contributing causes I believe … the fact that a bilateral radio compass is used there were partly responsible.” Hunter also floated the “possibility” that “abnormal currents caused by the Japanese earthquake” contributed to the problem. In response, the lieutenant commander in charge of the Point Arguello lighthouse took the stand, defending his compass bearings that night. In fact, the readings had been within a few degrees of accuracy the whole time, even if one of them had required a reciprocal adjustment.', 'Many of Watson’s other commanders said that they weren’t responsible for what had happened because they’d been duty-bound to follow the Delphy’s lead. The Navy’s sacred adherence to chain of command suddenly was on trial, too. Robert Morris, the commander of the division of ships immediately astern of the Delphy, said that they “could not possibly be held culpable in carrying out the destroyer doctrine of following their leader.” Rear Admiral Pratt asked Morris, “Does seniority take the place of common sense?” Morris replied, “They are supposed to be synonymous.”', 'Not every skipper had hewed so tightly to that edict. Thomas A. Symington of the Thompson, the last ship in line, said that once he’d noticed the confusion of lights and sirens ahead, he slowed down to take soundings. Leslie Bratton of the Stoddert said that he’d opted to violate the no-navigation order and asked the lighthouse for radio bearings himself, then steered his ship away in time to avoid disaster. Hardy B. Page, navigator of the Hamilton, said that he’d suspected there was a problem ahead and advised his commanding officer to get word to the division commander—a decision that helped the division’s three ships escape intact.', 'Finally, the board heard from Walter Roper—the division commander who a few hours before the disaster had jousted with Watson by radio about helping the Cuba. Roper was as flinty on the stand as he’d been that night on the water. “I’m not a desk man. My experience comes from hard knocks,” he said, a jab at Watson’s lack of experience and Hunter’s academy training. “There are too many book-learned and not enough practical men running the Navy.” In Roper’s view, those on the Delphy should never have assumed that the ship really was going 20 knots in such choppy water. The error, he said, was in putting “too much reliance on computation of speed by propeller revolutions.” In his experience, he said, he’d seen propellers indicate 20 knots when the ship was in fact going only 12.', 'Roper made a point of saying that he would have heeded the lighthouse. “I have gone into the most dangerous harbors in the world through impenetrable fogs, guided almost wholly by radio compass,” he said. His division had never turned left, he testified, because he never came close to trusting the Delphy. “I was positive we had not passed Point Arguello. I did not know the forward ships were turning. Could I have seen them, I would not have followed, but instead would have tried to stop them. My motto is ‘Never try to turn a corner until you have passed.’\u202f”', 'Rear Admiral Pratt asked Roper if he would have turned left had he been on the ship behind the Delphy. “Of course I would not,” Roper said. “\u202f‘Follow the leader’ is all right, but it should be tempered with common sense. When I was a boy, our leader once jumped off a barn. I stayed put—and walked down to pick him up. He had a broken leg.” The room erupted with laughter.', 'But the fact remained that Roper failed to speak up against Watson at the time. Had he been stinging from their quarrel over the Cuba? If he’d said something—one of many ifs that night—might the entire disaster have been avoided, and 23 lives spared?', 'On October 12, the court of inquiry made its determination. Never mind the weather and the radio; the Honda Point disaster, the court ruled, was the result of “bad errors and faulty navigation.” Faced with so much uncertainty, the ships should have slowed down to take depth soundings. Following the leader may have been a Navy tradition, but it shouldn’t trump reason.', 'Eleven officers were recommended for court-martial. Watson, Hunter, and Blodgett were charged with “culpable inefficiency and negligence,” and eight others with simple negligence. But the court seemed gripped by contradictory impulses. It issued a letter to Calhoun, the Young’s commander, commending him “for coolness, intelligence, and seamanlike ability,” and to Walter D. Seed, of the Fuller, for “great bravery in swimming … about seventy five yards, through a rough and turbulent sea … for the salvage of the crew.” Yet both also faced charges of negligence.', 'The court-martial proceedings took place in rapid succession during the month of November. All eyes remained on Watson. Would his penitence spare the others? On November 7, Watson doubled down with another public statement. “I am ready and anxious to take my medicine. I don’t want an acquittal. For me to be acquitted by this court would be bad for the naval service, to which both my father and myself have devoted our lives.”', 'Calhoun, at his trial, went out of his way to commend Watson. He testified that in his opinion no power on earth could have saved the Young and the other ships after the Delphy ran aground. Calhoun insisted that he had no reason to suspect the Delphy of any errors, and testified that he and the Young’s crew would not have done anything differently had they been at the front of the line—except perhaps take soundings.', 'Watson reciprocated as a witness at Calhoun’s trial. “Every man of the crew of the Young owes his life solely and entirely to Commander Calhoun,” he testified.', 'In his summation speech in Watson’s trial, Watson’s lawyer, Thomas T. Craven, noted how, at Honda Point, “fate was indeed stern upon this occasion.” If the Delphy had continued south for just a few more minutes before turning, the entire column of ships would have cleared the rocks. If they’d turned a few minutes sooner, the coast would have been more forgiving, resulting in less damage and fewer lives lost. How many Navy men, Craven asked, had made similarly small missteps and escaped the hand of fate? Watson, he suggested, was a victim of bad luck.', 'Calhoun was acquitted after 40 minutes of deliberation. Blodgett, the Delphy’s navigator, was also acquitted, as were seven other defendants. There were just two convictions:\xa0Edward Howe Watson and Donald T. Hunter would not escape official blame for what happened that night. But considering the scale of the catastrophe, their sentences were lighter than expected. Both Watson and Hunter were allowed to continue their military careers, but with lower ranking numbers, which virtually eliminated the possibility of promotion. Neither would command a ship again, but they would retain their ranks. And the careers of the other men would be saved.', '“It is a very proper sentence,” Watson told reporters. “It is a fitting punishment. The loss of a few numbers could not be a sufficient punishment for an error as great as mine was. I am glad that the sentence is as severe as it is. It puts me very near the bottom of the list of captains, I guess. Needless to say, it does not make me happy.”', 'Watson had transformed from a villain to a hero with his admission in September. Now, in December, with his career intact, things changed again. Back Watson went, from hero to goat. Yet, by taking the blame, had Watson—no matter how gallant the gesture—simply given the Navy a smooth path toward putting the embarrassing episode behind it? And was the Navy now rewarding Watson for his contrition? After the loss of seven ships and 23 lives, how was it exactly that not one member of the Navy had lost their job?', '“Just learned court-martial has been very lenient with everybody,” President Calvin Coolidge said. Navy Secretary Denby also made sure to grumble publicly that the “sentence in [Watson’s] case is inadequate.”', 'On December 29, the Army and Navy Journal reported, “The light sentence created almost as great a sensation at Washington as the disaster.”', 'Eugene Dooman’s escape from the scene at Honda Point occurred just before dawn after the wrecks, when a train to Los Angeles approached the local station where the relief efforts were headquartered. Watson told Dooman and a few others to board it. Hundreds of other men would be taking the San Diego train a few hours later. Dooman, like many in the squadron, was covered from head to foot with oil, so a conductor placed some newspapers on the seat, and off they went. In Los Angeles, Dooman was on his own again, delivered from the tragedy—and from the official narrative.', 'The available record from the court of inquiry and Watson’s court-martial includes just one mention of a civilian on the Delphy, but Dooman’s name never appears. In the years to come, as military and civilian historians researched the Honda Point disaster, the idea of a not-spoken-for witness to the disaster proved tantalizing. He was called the “mystery guest,” the “civilian,” the “phantom passenger.” Rumors circulated that he and Watson had been drinking that day (Watson and others denied this), or that Watson subsequently swore him to silence about what really went wrong that night. But while Dooman’s identity was never well publicized, it was never really secret either. In January 1924, he gave a long interview to an English-language paper in Japan, complimenting Watson’s performance on the night of the wreck and relating the tale of his own escape. Had the historians and writers seen that article, the mystery would have been solved.', 'After 30 years as a diplomat in Tokyo, Dooman came home to America after Pearl Harbor, retiring just a few years later, in 1945. It took until the 1960s for him to be located and asked about Honda Point. “I am not competent” to pass judgment on Watson’s decisions that day, he wrote one interlocutor in 1966. “That is to say, I cannot weigh the extenuating circumstances, but a disaster did occur and the man who made the decision had to assume responsibility.”', 'Dooman was asked why he was never called to testify in the inquiry, and what happened to the $3,000 in silver he’d brought on board. The answers, it turned out, were linked. The silver was sacrificed, Dooman wrote, in the name of discretion. The money had been found in the wreckage, he wrote, “but could not be claimed without the probability of being called as a witness in the court-martial, and Watson and his defense officer were afraid that my testimony might prove harmful to Watson, since I was with him when the ship struck.” By today’s standards, these actions would have constituted a cover-up. But every answer Dooman gave seemed to prompt more questions. Why had the Navy not asked him to testify? Did his job in the State Department play a part in that decision? Or was the Navy afraid that additional testimony from a civilian passenger would add yet more unwelcome intrigue to a debacle it wished would just go away?', 'Dooman wouldn’t say. But he and Watson remained friends for years. A few days after the disaster, Dooman explained, with the inquiry not yet begun, he’d paid a visit to Watson and his wife at their home in San Diego. (Some armchair historians, parsing the disaster’s themes of negligence and culpability, have gone so far as to wonder if the captain reimbursed Dooman his lost $3,000 in return for his discretion. If such a thing occurred, Dooman never mentioned it.) The Watsons would later visit Japan, in 1937, and dine with Dooman there. He curtly alluded to the price Watson paid for the tragedy, the toll it took on him. “After the disaster,” Dooman wrote, “he lost his zest for living and became very despondent.”', 'Just after the court-martial, Dooman wrote a letter to Watson, one of dozens sent by friends and well-wishers hoping to soften the blow. “Do you know what a splendid impression you have made on everybody,” the diplomat wrote from Washington, “not only those high in the Navy but the man in the street? I dined with Admiral Knight who said splendid things about you. I think you will appreciate even more, though, what I overheard in the cars the other day—‘Well,’ said one, ‘I don’t get this stuff about the compass, but as long as we have fellows in the Navy like this guy who took the blame we shouldn’t worry.’\u202f”', 'William Calhoun was cleared of any blame for the Young’s tragedy; he was even commended for his cool demeanor during the rescue. But the loss of 20 men weighed heavily on him, and for a time it seemed foolish to assume that Calhoun would command a ship again. Eventually, however, his career righted itself. After serving on several ships, further instruction at the Naval War College, and a stint as an instructor at the Naval Academy, Calhoun returned to sea as commanding officer of the USS Rochester, and later the USS California. In 1938, he was promoted to rear admiral. The next year, he became commander of the Navy’s Pacific base in Honolulu and remained in that position through World War II. “There was nothing the fleet wanted that Uncle Bill wouldn’t get,” one commander would say.', 'Calhoun retired in 1946 a four-star admiral, after 44 years of active service. There was just one thing missing from his time at sea: He never saw battle. For that he’d be granted some satisfaction from the author James A. Michener, who’d been a lieutenant commander under Calhoun during the war. “Those of us who worked for Uncle Billy believed that he had played a major role in smothering the Japanese with matériel,” Michener wrote in his memoirs, “and the fighting admirals agreed.” In Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific—the Pulitzer Prize–winning basis for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical—Calhoun is said to be the model for Millard Kester, a grounded admiral who finally gets to do battle at sea, leading an entire invasion force. And winning.', 'Calhoun died in 1963; he had married and was a grandfather many times over. In 1984, some 61 years after the disaster, a scuba diver and amateur treasure hunter exploring the California coast noticed something shiny on the ocean floor, churned up by a recent storm: a class ring from the Naval Academy. It didn’t take long to connect the ring to its deceased owner. The diver had hoped to make some money for a discovery from the site of the disaster. One collector offered him $1,500. Then a fellow diver let him know that Calhoun’s widow, Rosalie, was alive and living in Coronado, near San Diego. Her phone number was listed. He agreed to sell the ring to her for $400—the cost of the dive, he said.', 'Rosalie had never remarried. The ring, when the diver handed it over, stirred something in her. “It’s like part of him was brought back,” she said, filled with emotion for her lost husband.', 'On December 14, 1923, six days after Edward Howe Watson’s conviction in a Navy court-martial, his father, retired admiral John Crittenden Watson, died at 81. A fellow retired admiral, Colby M. Chester, wrote to the younger Watson that same day: “Your name was the last one uttered by your father, and I know how happy the Honda affair made him.” Happy that\xa0his son’s career was intact, perhaps. Or that the family name had, despite everything, retained some of its dignity.\xa0', 'On January 10, 1924, Watson along with his wife and daughter moved to Honolulu, where he was stationed until his retirement five years later. In the 1930s, the Watsons lived in New York and then in Jamestown, Rhode Island, visiting Japan several times. In the years before World War II, Watson indulged his fascination with Japan, writing poems about historic Japanese figures. That other existence he might have led before Honda Point—the life of a sly and insightful Navy attaché, drawing out spies and supplying Washington with essential information about a potentially lethal foe—seemed to loom large for him.', 'In the late 1930s, Watson drafted a long policy memo about Japan to a friend at the Naval War College, still hoping someone would heed his warnings—“stuff that I have worked up during the past 5 years, since my retirement,” as he described it. “Perhaps it will help to save many hours to some fellow who is doing a bit of research work on the subject. Dispose of it as your judgment dictates. Either in the files or by burning.”', 'Watson died of heart disease in a Navy hospital on January 7, 1942, a month to the day after Pearl Harbor proved his point. His family later said that they thought the attack had hastened his death. Honda Point was not mentioned in any of his published obituaries.', 'Watson had pursued a life of significance, of honor. At Honda Point, the son emulated the father, following the traditions of leadership codified by an entire generation—and those same traditions contributed to the disaster. But after the worst happened, and the nation had judged him, he chose to preserve his character. In doing so, he acquired a different kind of significance, one he hadn’t expected.', 'In his papers, there is a letter from Watson’s father written on October 1, 1923, just after Watson had publicly accepted responsibility for the error that cost the Navy seven ships and 23 lives. In its tone, the letter was far warmer and more effusive than the one that had preceded it. “I cannot express in any words how proud we are of you and of your devoted wife,” the father wrote.', 'In the letter, Watson’s father offered his son a gift. He said that a relative of the late Admiral David Farragut had written to him “to express his confidence in you,” and sent along a precious keepsake: a makeshift tourniquet the elder Watson had made aboard the Hartford during the Civil War, “just as we were about to pass up the Mississippi by the Confederate batteries.”', 'Farragut had given this rag—a relic of John Crittenden’s most glorious moment in the Navy—to his own son “to use in case of a wound.” Now it seemed that someone else had a better use for it. “When I wrote him I know you would love to have it, he sent it to me,” Watson’s father wrote. “I will hold it for you until you come East. All of us join in ever much love to all three of you.”', 'And so Edward Howe Watson was offered a tourniquet—a message from father to son. His son was wounded and needed care. His son was worthy of greatness. His son was a Watson. And in court his son had not shirked from his duty to do what the father never had to do: go down with his ship.', '© 2023 The Atavist Magazine.

But the loss of 20 men weighed heavily on him, and for a time it seemed foolish to assume that Calhoun would command a ship again. Eventually, however, his career righted itself. After serving on several ships, further instruction at the Naval War College, and a stint as an instructor at the Naval Academy, Calhoun returned to sea as commanding officer of the USS Rochester, and later the USS California. In 1938, he was promoted to rear admiral. The next year, he became commander of the Navy’s Pacific base in Honolulu and remained in that position through World War II. “There was nothing the fleet wanted that Uncle Bill wouldn’t get,” one commander would say.', 'Calhoun retired in 1946 a four-star admiral, after 44 years of active service. There was just one thing missing from his time at sea: He never saw battle. For that he’d be granted some satisfaction from the author James A. Michener, who’d been a lieutenant commander under Calhoun during the war. “Those of us who worked for Uncle Billy believed that he had played a major role in smothering the Japanese with matériel,” Michener wrote in his memoirs, “and the fighting admirals agreed.” In Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific—the Pulitzer Prize–winning basis for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical—Calhoun is said to be the model for Millard Kester, a grounded admiral who finally gets to do battle at sea, leading an entire invasion force. And winning.', 'Calhoun died in 1963; he had married and was a grandfather many times over.

It didn’t take long to connect the ring to its deceased owner. The diver had hoped to make some money for a discovery from the site of the disaster. One collector offered him $1,500.

India’s fuel quality standards have been gradually tightened since the mid 1990s. Low-lead gasoline was introduced in 1994 in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. In 2000, unleaded gasoline was mandated nationwide. India has adopted the European template for vehicle emissions and fuel quality standards, and the standards are termed as Bharat Stages (BS) In other words, Bharat Stage III standards are equivalent to Euro 3 standards.', 'After lead, sulfur content is the second most important determiner of fuel quality. Sulfur inhibits the proper functioning of aftertreatment systems designed to reduce tailpipe emissions and corrodes engines and pipes. The effect of fuel sulfur content is particularly damaging to three types of aftertreatment systems: diesel particulate filters (DPFs), lean NOx traps (LNTs), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR).', 'In 2016, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway issued a draft notification of BS VI emission standards, equivalent to Euro VI. In April 2020, the standards took effect throughout the country for all light- and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as two- and three-wheelers manufactured. The BS VI standard specifies 10 ppm sulfur for both gasoline and diesel fuels. In conjunction with the proposed BS VI emission standard, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) announced a nationwide supply of BS VI fuel would be available .

Olefins, which were also unregulated under BS II, now stand at 21% and 18% for regular unleaded and premium unleaded, respectively, under BS III and BS IV regulations.

Asking for reassurance': ['When you’re worried or afraid, nothing could be more natural than wanting reassurance that everything is going to be okay:', 'And it works!', 'Sort of…', 'When we feel anxious, ask for reassurance, and then get it, we temporarily feel relieved of our anxiety and fears. Like a fast-acting pain medication, reassurance is great at alleviating emotional pain and doubt in the short term. But just like all pain medication, reassurance is a Band-Aid that treats the symptoms, not the cause.', 'Maybe you get relief for a few hours, a few minutes… maybe just a few short seconds and then, inevitably, the fear and worry and insecurity are back, usually stronger than ever.', 'Here’s how it works:', 'The solution to this dilemma of reassurance-seeking and continually worse confidence is in a very subtle distinction when it comes to fear:', 'If you want to be more confident, you must train your brain to believe that feeling anxious is uncomfortable but not dangerous. That it’s something you can handle. But your brain’s never going to believe you can handle your fear and insecurities if you’re always running to other people to get reassurance.', 'The next time you feel anxious, validate that feeling as scary and uncomfortable, but remind yourself that simply being afraid isn’t dangerous.', 'Show your brain that you can tolerate feeling afraid without resorting to reassurance-seeking, and it will reward you with confidence in the future.'], '2. Worrying about things they can’t control': ['Worry is the flip side of rumination. Just like rumination is unhelpful thinking about mistakes or bad things in the past, worry is unhelpful thinking about potential dangers in the future:', 'We all know worry makes us feel awful — anxious and stressed in the short term, but also lacking in confidence and self-worth in the long-term. And yet, we keep doing it. Over and over and over again… Why?', 'The key to understanding worry is that, like rumination, in the very short-term it actually feels good! Worry gives us the illusion of control.', 'On a primitive level, we believe that if we think hard enough and long enough and prepare ourselves for every possible negative outcome, things will be better — people we love will stay safe, disasters will be averted, etc. But more importantly, worry preoccupies our mind. It gives us something to do instead of simply feeling scared or helpless or unsure.', 'The problem is, the act of worrying trains our brain to believe that those imaginary bad things are real and likely possibilities, which keeps us anxious and afraid in the long run.', 'None of us like feeling out of control. But it’s a fundamental truth of reality that we can’t control everything — especially the two things most worriers obsess about: the future and other people.', 'The key to undoing the habit of worry, lowering your chronic anxiety, and building up your confidence is to become okay with lack of control.', 'If you can practice acknowledging and accepting how little control you actually have in your life, you’ll find your confidence will grow. And on top of that, you’ll have more energy and time to invest in the things you do actually have control over.', 'If you want to be confident, stop worrying about the life you don’t have and take responsibility for the life you do have.'], '3. Dwelling on past mistakes': ['Rumination is form of thinking where we repeatedly review and replay previous mistakes or negative events in the past even thought doing so has no real benefit but does have the side-effect feeling bad about yourself:', 'But if rumination is so unhelpful and only makes us feel bad about ourselves and saps us of confidence, why do we do it? Why does it feel so compulsive?', 'Like reassurance-seeking, rumination does kind of work in a superficial sense.', 'See, rumination is a form of thinking very close to problem-solving, analysis, and reflection — all of which tend to be helpful and positive. So when we ruminate, we often feel as if we’re doing something constructive — we’re thinking about it, and thinking’s always good!', 'Not really. Even if a fact is true — you did make mistakes as a father, you did screw up a portion of your presentation — continuing to think about it isn’t necessarily helpful.', 'This is the key distinction:', 'Just because something is true doesn’t mean thinking more about it is helpful.', 'Even though rumination erodes our confidence and wellbeing in the long-run, we easily get addicted to it because it actually feels good in the very short-term. It makes us feel competent and proactive, which briefly alleviates the strong discomfort of helplessness.', 'When mistakes have been made, we can’t actually change them. Intellectually that may sound obvious, but experientially it’s a fact we avoid and deny like the plague because it feels so awful to acknowledge.', 'The key to undoing a habit of rumination and useless self-criticism is to realize what you’re getting out of it and how it’s not really worth it.', 'Is the temporary relief of helplessness really worth the long-term blows to your confidence? Is that brief feeling of “I can figure this out!” really worth a night of terrible sleep and sluggishness the next day?', 'Learn to accept helplessness and uncertainty. We make mistakes. And often we can’t do anything about it. Such is life. The best we can do is work to be better going forward. And one of the best ways to be better in the future is to improve our confidence and self-worth.', 'So drop the habit of rumination and give yourself permission to live life going forward instead of keeping yourself a prisoner of the past.'], '4. Relying on feelings to make decisions': ['Confident people use values-based reasoning to make decisions, not emotion-based reasoning.', 'Imagine the following scenario most of us have found ourselves in in some form or another:', 'This is emotion-based reasoning.', 'You’ve made a decision based primarily on how you feel, rather than what’s most important to you. Your value was to start exercising regularly to improve your health (and physique, of course!). Your feeling was anxiety over the discomfort of running in the cold and the relief of your warm toasty bed. Ultimately, you decided to stay in bed in order to avoid the discomfort of getting up early and going for a run.', 'Now, I’m not here to tell you that going for a run at 5:00 AM is good or bad, right or wrong, healthy or not. The point is that you made that decision and then chose to act otherwise. And that’s a problem for your confidence.', 'Each time you say something’s important, then act contrary to that commitment, you teach your brain that you can’t be trusted and that you’re not reliable. And the biggest reason we all do this is because our feelings tell us something different.', 'See, our feelings and emotions tend to be oriented toward what feels good in the short-term: Avoiding pain, feeling pleasure, eliminating uncertainty, etc… Of course, there’s nothing wrong with any of these per se.', 'The problem is, the pursuit of feeling good now, often comes at the expense of doing good in the future:', 'On the other hand, when we regularly follow-through on what we say is important to us, our brain trusts us more. Which means, the next time we’re faced with something difficult, your brain is likely to respond with confidence (Yeah, we got this!) as opposed to fear (I don’t know… Seems too tough.).', 'If you want to build confidence, you need to change your relationship with your emotions.', 'Begin in small ways to consistently follow through on decisions you’ve committed to, each time knowing that you’re building trust in yourself. And when your brain really starts to trust that you’re the kind of person who goes after what’s really important — as opposed to what feels good or easy now — that’s when the confidence comes.'], 'All You Need to Know': ['If you struggle with low self-confidence, a new strategy might be to approach it in reverse: Rather than trying to do things that will add confidence or make you feel more confident, work on eliminating things that are killing your confidence…'], '🧠 💪 Get more ideas for improving your confidence': ['Each week, I send out a newsletter with simple, practical tips for building emotional health and wellbeing.

Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe (1958)': ['“It’s the ideal postcolonial novel. Its inventive idiomatic prose highlights the malleability of the English language: no other writer (or translator) has evoked the true essence of another language in English. Period.” Steven Ikeme', '“Brilliant, distinctive, thought-provoking and illuminating of a sense of place and time. Also quite readable.” Ryan', '“This book is a seminal piece of great story telling. Set in the advent of colonialism and its implications for the native people, the clash of cultures of two different worlds.A story of how a way of life was replaced by another culture.” Kinnie Hindowah', '“It’s an excellent example of black African writing in English of which I felt your list was sadly lacking. Black African novelists are often sorely under represented in literary criticism and lists of this kind. In Things Fall Apart, Achebe explores the colonial experience by arguably using the tools of colonialism itself, ie the English language. The story is told from the African perspective and his use of African colloquialisms and proverbs is genuinely subversive and innovative.” Nathan Loughran', '“As a non-native English speaker and someone who grew up in an Asian culture, English as a language appears very articulate and clear to me. And most well written English literature works, including poems, embody such almost straightforward characters, both in their wording and storytelling ... until I read Arundhati Roy’s The God of Small Things. I still remember how struck I was to see the English words be played in a way that’s mostly familiar to me in other Asian literature. The gentle singsong wording and wave-like storytelling combined with the vividness of English captured me like a dream. I’ve read many more English novels since, some as captivating and clever, but none carries the same magic.” Ling', '“The God of Small Things – though a fairly recent book – resonates very strongly with me. It explores caste, sexism, colonialism and the strange unspoken rules that tie Indian families together. Like in most great novels, the prose itself is stunning, with imagery fresh and original and at the same time, somehow familiar. I’m a girl from a South Indian village and I was raised by a single mother and my grandmother. Perhaps it is this coincidence that ties me so strongly to the book, to see in tangible words the burden that history passes along to Indian women.” Sita', '“I have never been so moved by a book as this one. Every character is complete and completely human; the plot is intricate and perfectly woven; the sentences sparkle with lapidary precision. When common words fail, she creates her own lexicon (a device I usually loathe in lesser hands) and creates poetry within the prose – ‘Furrywhirring,’ ‘Sariflapping,’ ‘ OrangedrinkLemondrink Man’, ‘fatly baffled.’ The description of the God of Small Things or mundane tragedies as a flippant, skipping boy in short pants is as evocative as it is heart breaking. Roy frames tragic personal stories within the context of the greater tragedy of Indian social strictures and politics. And the ending made me cry for two solid hours. I read the book four years ago and writing this critique is making my throat tighten even now, such is its incandescent power and brilliance.” Pam Norris', '“Brutal, heartbreaking and beautiful.” Tanith', '“Beloved is one of the greatest novels ever written – in any language or culture, any genre or generation, any time or clime. It is a measure of Morrison’s rare and remarkable gift as a writer that one can say of this innovative novel: all humanity is here. It is the most extraordinary excavation of the bones and ghosts of American history (slavery, lynching, Jim Crow segregation), limned in a deeply haunting, profoundly moving multi-layered epic tragedy. With compelling candour, courage and conviction, Morrison’s imperishable masterpiece distils an eerie evocation of mood, setting, landscape and atmosphere, a complex, even complicated deployment of character and characterisation, multiple points of view from an interlude of astutely individuated voices. [...] Toni Morrison’s Beloved is, as TS Eliot wrote of James Joyce’s Ulysses, ‘a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.’” Idowu Omoyele', '“This novel is important to English literature in three respects. Firstly, it not only broaches a significant historical topic (American slavery), but in many ways prescribes solutions to our treatment of slavery’s history. The novel also uses a beautiful and poetic style to hone in its themes. Lastly, Morrison utilises magical realism to enhance the setting and the characters that occupy it. Morrison is one of the first American authors to use magical realism as a primary stylistic choice.” Sean Fortenberry', '“Despite the passage of time, I have not forgotten how prescient The Handmaid’s Tale was, and how prescient it felt. She described a future that didn’t seem so far-fetched. Living in America gives you a sense, sometimes, that the fundamentalist Christians, with their literalist readings of the Bible, would be capable of reading the story of an infertile woman who had her husband impregnate her handmaid and see that as a solution to infertility in the modern age. And Atwood not only gets the reading of the Bible correct, she also foresaw that we would wreck the planet at the level of reproduction, too. Sometimes, when another “crazy” thing comes to pass in American politics/culture, I find myself thinking that we’re moving closer to Atwood’s nightmare future. If you combine that prescience with Atwood’s deft handling of language – she really is a prose virtuosa – and you have the making of a classic.” Lorraine Berry', '“McCarthy is certainly one of the finest living authors in the world today and this novel is his best ... A Texan, his dark descriptions of the American West are second to none. His voice is unique and unmatched in its originality. This is a novel which hypnotises, horrifies and leaves the reader as dazed as man who has stood too close to freight-train as it has roared by his head. Jolting and vividly spattered with blood, the pages brand themselves deeply into the readers memory and imagination: A true American masterpiece crafted by a true master.” Mark Hall', '“It is the best novel written in the twentieth century. It tells a fascinating and complex story with incredible power. It demonstrates McCarthy’s total mastery of both language and narrative. It has arguably the greatest villain ever written. It shows the utter superfluousness of punctuation. It evokes a little-known period in American history with startling beauty and incredible realism.” TheMarxOfProgress', '“Mccarthy’s novel is a masterpiece with a nihilistic bent and lurid prose. The Judge is one of the most sinister characters in the history of literature.” Jay Tucker', '“This is the one book that whisked me away to India. It shows you a world that you’ve maybe never thought about before, it makes you feel empathy for the struggles of Indian beggars, it shows you what life was like in the countryside and in the city. It’s a caleidoscope of people and stories. It educates you about Indian politics and history. And it’s a very moving book as well. It can bring tears into your eyes (not mine of course, I’m talking about a friend...)” Isabelle Meyer', '“A great and fluid command of the language, an achingly accurate portrayal of the complexity of human choices, startling humour in places you least expect, tender treatment of the tragedy that is the human condition... This book takes you right into the drama of ordinary, seemingly forgettable lives.” Vivian Ligo', '“It is a beautifully written, tragic tale of how four characters from different backgrounds join together, but how their lives follow different paths because of their caste. Even though it’s so very sad, there is so much love and humour and the irony that it’s the ‘luckiest’ character who is the most miserable!” Kim', '“David Foster Wallace was a creative force that measured the disillusion and sadness of a generation of people who felt emptiness that took a shape that no-one could really identify or wrestle with. Infinite Jest, his magnum opus, represents all of these feelings and more. It is a work that confronts the substance of how happiness is truly fleeting. A work over-brimming with intelligence, humour, pathos and insight. I can think of few works that capture the mood of a time as Infinite Jest does. It is prescient, chilling, hilarious, comforting, and all of it simultaneously.” Ben James', '“The best writer of his generation has to have a spot on the list. The best novel of the past 20 years is hilarious, sad and absurd – often within the same page. At over 1,000 pages you’ll struggle through bits of it, and suddenly you’ll realise you’ve finished and want to immediately start again.” Jay Tucker', '“Slaughterhouse Five is an eclectic telling of a tragedy told by Vonnegut, who was there during the Dresden bombing. It brings a unique satire to an otherwise terrible event and it is told with poignancy. Vonnegut’s anti-war story was a triumph of literature.” Mario Velarde', '“Such a short and easy to read book, it takes an interesting, quirky and meaningful approach to a horrific event in our history. Very imaginative, poignant and at times shocking, it has stayed with me for a long time each time I’ve read it.” Ciara Dawson', '“Tolkien defined the Fantasy genre with his epic storytelling and world building.” Gerd Duerner', '“Setting up the genre for the next six decades, there is simply no other work of literature this ambitious. Powerful, profound, poignant, and linguistically pure.” Jorge', '“It is an incredibly well written book by a very talented man. A masterpiece that inspired many writers in the genre. To me, it was a book that helped me through some dark times. It inspired me with the beauty of the writing (Tolkien is a masterful writer), and the great messages within the story.” Kim Anisi', '“It makes a protagonist of he who is literature’s all-time ultimate villain and simultaneously the personification of all villainy. With this character at the book’s heart, the author explores, amongst many other themes, some of humanity’s darkest and most dreadful moral transgressions. Duncan manages this with unflinching clarity, intelligently devised detail and a craftsman’s weave of one-liners, observational humour, hilarious characters and broadly applied satire. To me, while first reading it, then returning immediately to the first page for another go, it was clear that I may never enjoy a novel so much again. That has stuck true for over ten years now.” David Pooley', '“It manages to answer the primal questions about the relationship between God & the Devil. A reasonably good theologian could probably shoot it down in flames, but like Milton’s Satan, he is beautiful, bright and flawed. Duncan writes like an angel and Lucifer ... well, you’ll just have to read it.” Laura Andrus', '“A good novel will leave you a different person than when you began it, and I honestly don’t think there are any books that have changed so many people’s lives like Harry Potter novels have. While perhaps not the best written books when compared to other masterpieces on the list, the detail of the Harry Potter universe and the engaging characters and storylines are works of genius. Rowling captures the imagination like no other author can, and that is why she deserves to be on the list of greatest novels.” Andrew Thornbury', '“I have chosen this series because it means something to me both as a reader and a teacher. I have seen children that wouldn’t usually choose reading as a way to pass the time become completely engrossed in these books. It is also true to say that if you enjoy reading something as a young person, there is a likelihood that you will also enjoy re-reading the same text. As a child I very much enjoyed reading these, and I still do today!” Charlotte Fox', '“This is the key work in contemporary Scottish fiction, which initiates the renaissance in Scottish writing. Its influence can also be detected across the wider ‘postmodern’ context, by pushing the frontiers of the novel. No Ali Smith, David Mitchell, Will Self et al without Lanark.” Edmund Smyth', '“The greatest Scottish novel of 20th century: personal and political, parochial and universal, it strides across the realist and fantasy genres with a playful but urgent post-modernism.” Grant Rintoul', '“Why no sci-fi? Stranger in a Strange Land, Heinlein’s masterpiece, transcends the genre, as it is as much a groundbreaking social, political, religious, and sexual commentary on what it is to be human, obliterating taboos of the era. It was way ahead of its time. As if that wasn’t enough, Jubal Harshaw has to be one of the most memorable characters in all of fiction.” Michael Yaros', '“This novel correctly defined ‘love’ for me, as ‘the state in which the welfare and happiness of another become essential to your own.’” Spider Robinson', '“As a non-white, non-Western reader of English language fiction since early childhood, I had begun to internalise the idea that good fiction needed to meet the standards set by dead straight white men. Then when I was 18 I read this novel and it blew my mind – the narrative voice, characters and plot sensitised me to racism and sexism in ways that I had never encountered (and have yet to encounter) in novels authored by straight white men. And though I am not an African-American woman, it validated and enlarged my existence, which is what I think the best fiction is capable of.” Shanon Shah', '“Any list of great books needs to include this, or is simply incomplete. The Color Purple was the first book that truly touched me and really forced me to think.” Denise Paradise', '“This was a life-changing work for me. It totally changed the way I looked at time, gender, race, sanity, utopia and dystopia. I first read it in my late teens and I’ve reread it frequently. I always find something new, or interpret it slightly differently. It questions why we need gender designation, offering a gender neutral ‘per’. It offers a three-parent society. It contrasts sexism, racism and the chemical coshing of a mental health patient with a utopia that doesn’t contain any of these issues. It leaves us with the idea that, in interfering with the mind, as the central character’s brain is operated on, we change the possible future available to us. It touched on so many issues that matter in my life, and in society generally, that the added question of what reality means became academic.” Laura Albero', '“The book is inspired and is aesthetically superb and socially salvific.” The Revd Linda Isiorho', 'Do you have a book to add to the list? You can still take part by leaving a comment below.'], '2. The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy (1997)': ['“As a non-native English speaker and someone who grew up in an Asian culture, English as a language appears very articulate and clear to me.

The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood (1985)': ['“Despite the passage of time, I have not forgotten how prescient The Handmaid’s Tale was, and how prescient it felt. She described a future that didn’t seem so far-fetched. Living in America gives you a sense, sometimes, that the fundamentalist Christians, with their literalist readings of the Bible, would be capable of reading the story of an infertile woman who had her husband impregnate her handmaid and see that as a solution to infertility in the modern age. And Atwood not only gets the reading of the Bible correct, she also foresaw that we would wreck the planet at the level of reproduction, too. Sometimes, when another “crazy” thing comes to pass in American politics/culture, I find myself thinking that we’re moving closer to Atwood’s nightmare future. If you combine that prescience with Atwood’s deft handling of language – she really is a prose virtuosa – and you have the making of a classic.” Lorraine Berry', '“McCarthy is certainly one of the finest living authors in the world today and this novel is his best ... A Texan, his dark descriptions of the American West are second to none. His voice is unique and unmatched in its originality.

In 220 BCE, China’s first Emperor Qin Shi Huang masterminded the unification of all China’s walls into one almighty barrier, strengthening and extending the wall to keep out northern invaders.

Made from reinforced concrete clad in over 6 million soapstone tiles, Christ the Redeemer is the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world.

First two men who managed to do that were Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman and English scientist Joseph Priestley in second half of 18th century. After their discovery, others inventors started developing their processes, many patents were issued, manufacture started, and general population of United States and Europe got the chance to taste first new products carbonated water and soft drink products. It is important to mention that one of the reasons why sugary soft drinks managed to become so popular was not only because they were initially targeted as a “fun summer drink”, but also because pharmacist infused early soft drink recipes with powerful stimulants that actively tried to change the emotional state of the user. Most popular of these stimulants were coffee, cola nuts and coca leaves, all able to ward off fatigue and clear mind for brief moments.

Choosing chicken: For starters, you can choose what kind of chicken you prefer. Be it boneless thighs, or a whole bird that is cut into pieces, you can be selective. Most people love fried drumsticks. But you can also use chicken breasts & thighs. ', 'White meat, dark, or an assortment of the two can please your own tastes, as well as your guests’. The point here is to use what works for you. For this recipe you will need 500 grams of chicken of your choice. ', '2. Brining: Next is the decision to brine or not to brine. The benefit of using a buttermilk brine is that it tenderizes the chicken and adds moisture while contributing a pleasing kiss of acidity. ', 'While skipping this step is an option, a soak in buttermilk for at least 4 hours will take your fried chicken to new heights which is certainly worth the extra planning.', 'To make the butter milk, add ½\xa0cup plain yogurt to a bowl and whisk it with 1 cup water. Add about ¼ teaspoon salt & give a good mix. You can also add some crushed black pepper if you like.', '3. Rinse chicken and add it here. Cover the bowl with a cling wrap and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight. Overnight gives best results. I do not suggest skipping this as the chicken won’t cook through properly without brining.', '4. When you are ready to make the fried chicken prepare the crumbs for coating. To a bowl add, 1 cup bread crumbs or panko crumbs. I used ¼ teaspoon allspice & ½ teaspoon red chilli powder or paprika. These are optional and you may add any other seasoning if you prefer here. ', '5. Break an egg to a bowl and separate the white.', '6. Remove the chicken pieces one after the other from the buttermilk and add them a large mixing bowl. Or drain the buttermilk from the chicken. We don’t want the buttermilk here. ', 'How you chose to bread the chicken is another way to create the fried chicken you are craving. Keeping it really neutral with just salt and pepper is absolutely fine, though adding a mix of herbs and spices will give it something truly special. Even a touch of cayenne pepper for some extra kick would please some tastes.', '7. My recipe uses all of the below seasonings. You may adjust to suit your taste. Add the following to the chicken.', 'Then add 2 tablespoons cornstarch and mix everything well to coat the chicken with the flour. ', '8. Pour the egg white to the chicken and 3 to 4 tablespoons buttermilk. Mix well. Chicken must be moist enough to hold the bread crumbs at the next stage. Pick up each piece of chicken & roll them in the bread crumbs.', '9. Press down each piece of chicken so the bread crumbs stick to the chicken well. Set aside for at least 10 minutes. A better way is to place these on a wired rack.', 'Selecting a neutral oil with a high smoke point is key here so vegetable, canola, or peanut oil are all good options. You want to steer clear of olive oil, due to its lower smoke point, as well as its tendency to transfer its flavor to whatever you are cooking. ', 'You want the chicken to be the star of the show here, so no added flavor from oil is best. ', '10. Heat oil of your choice in a heavy bottom deep pan. Check if the oil is hot enough. Then gently shake off the excess bread crumbs and add the breaded chicken to the hot oil. Fry till golden & crisp at medium high temperature. The oil should be hot enough and the flame at medium high.', 'Temperature: Optimal oil temperature here is right around 350 F degrees. Hotter than that, and you will risk burning the exterior before the chicken is thoroughly cooked.', '11. Once done, remove them to a kitchen towel and leave for 30 seconds.

If the chicken is not cooked through, you may refry them on a medium heat.', 'Enjoy fried chicken with your favorite dip or ketchup.', 'The great news is that you really do not need any special equipment when making fried chicken at home. In terms of equipment, here are a few things I would strongly recommend:', 'For those health-conscious cooks who crave fried chicken, but want to steer clear of deep frying, an air fryer may be the ticket.

During this era, early humans shared the planet with a number of now-extinct hominin relatives, including Neanderthals and Denisovans. ', 'In the Paleolithic period (roughly 2.5 million years ago to 10,000 B.C.), early humans lived in caves or simple huts or tepees and were hunters and gatherers. They used basic stone and bone tools, as well as crude stone axes, for hunting birds and wild animals. They cooked their prey, including woolly mammoths, deer and bison, using controlled fire. They also fished and collected berries, fruit and nuts. ', 'Ancient humans in the Paleolithic period were also the first to leave behind art. They used combinations of minerals, ochres, burnt bone meal and charcoal mixed into water, blood, animal fats and tree saps to etch humans, animals and signs. They also carved small figurines from stones, clay, bones and antlers.', 'The end of this period marked the end of the last Ice Age, which resulted in the extinction of many large mammals and rising sea levels and climate change that eventually caused man to migrate. ', 'During the Mesolithic period (about 10,000 B.C. to 8,000 B.C.), humans used small stone tools, now also polished and sometimes crafted with points and attached to antlers, bone or wood to serve as spears and arrows. They often lived nomadically in camps near rivers and other bodies of water. Agriculture was introduced during this time, which led to more permanent settlements in villages. ', 'Finally, during the Neolithic period (roughly 8,000 B.C. to 3,000 B.C.), ancient humans switched from hunter/gatherer mode to agriculture and food production. They domesticated animals and cultivated cereal grains. They used polished hand axes, adzes for plowing and tilling the land and started to settle in the plains. Advancements were made not only in tools but also in farming, home construction and art, including pottery, sewing and weaving.', 'During the Bronze Age (about 3,000 B.C. to 1,300 B.C.), metalworking advances were made, as bronze, a copper and tin alloy, was discovered. Now used for weapons and tools, the harder metal replaced its stone predecessors, and helped spark innovations including the ox-drawn plow and the wheel. ', 'This time period also brought advances in architecture and art, including the invention of the potter’s wheel, and textiles—clothing consisted of mostly wool items such as skirts, kilts, tunics and cloaks. Home dwellings morphed to so-called roundhouses, consisting of a circular stone wall with a thatched or turf roof, complete with a fireplace or hearth, and more villages and cities began to form.

Major pandemics and epidemics such as plague, cholera, flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have already afflicted humanity. The world is now facing the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Many infectious diseases leading to pandemics are caused by zoonotic pathogens that were transmitted to humans due to increased contacts with animals through breeding, hunting and global trade activities. The understanding of the mechanisms of transmission of pathogens to humans allowed the establishment of methods to prevent and control infections. During centuries, implementation of public health measures such as isolation, quarantine and border control helped to contain the spread of infectious diseases and maintain the structure of the society. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, these containment methods have still been used nowadays to control COVID-19 pandemic. Global surveillance programs of water-borne pathogens, vector-borne diseases and zoonotic spillovers at the animal-human interface are of prime importance to rapidly detect the emergence of infectious threats. Novel technologies for rapid diagnostic testing, contact tracing, drug repurposing, biomarkers of disease severity as well as new platforms for the development and production of vaccines are needed for an effective response in case of pandemics.'], 'Introduction': ['The shift from hunter-gatherers to agrarian societies has favored the spread of infectious diseases in the human population (Dobson and Carper, 1996). Expanded trades between communities have increased interactions between humans and animals and facilitated the transmission of zoonotic pathogens. Thereafter, expanded cities, extended trade territories, increased travels as well as effects on ecosystems due to increased human population raised the emergence and spread of infectious diseases leading to higher risks for outbreaks, epidemics and even pandemics (Lindahl and Grace, 2015).', 'The terms endemic, outbreak, epidemic and pandemic relate to the occurrence of a health condition compared to its predicted rate as well as to its spread in geographic areas (Grennan, 2019). An endemic condition occurs at a predictable rate among a population. An outbreak corresponds to an unpredicted increase in the number of people presenting a health condition or in the occurrence of cases in a new area. An epidemic is an outbreak that spreads to larger geographic areas. A pandemic is an epidemic that spreads globally.', 'An emerging infection newly appears in a population or is spread in a new geographic area (Morens et al., 2004). The zoonotic transmission of pathogens from animals to humans is a pivotal mechanism by which emerging infections have afflicted humans throughout history (Wolfe et al., 2007). The probability of cross-species transmission of pathogens was dramatically enhanced with increased interactions with animals through hunting, animal farming, trade of animal-based foods, wet markets or exotic pet trade (Bengis et al., 2004). The process of cross-species transmission of pathogens involves 5 different stages (Wolfe et al., 2007). (1) the pathogen exclusively infects animals under natural conditions; (2) the pathogen evolves so that it can be transmitted to humans but without sustained human-to-human transmission; (3) the pathogen undergoes only a few cycles of secondary transmission between humans; (4) the disease exists in animals but long sequences of secondary human-to-human transmission occur without the involvement of animal hosts; and (5) the disease occurs exclusively in humans. The animal species that harbor the pathogen, the nature of human interaction with that animal and the frequency of these interactions likely modulate the risk of zoonotic transmission. Furthermore, land use and climate changes are suggested to play important roles in the transmission of pathogens from wildlife to humans (El-Sayed and Kamel, 2020; White and Razgour, 2020). There is thus a need to implement surveillance programs to rapidly detect the emergence of pathogens with a potential for zoonotic transmission at the animal-human interface.', 'Climate changes also influence the transmission of pathogens (e.g., Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile viruses, Borrelia burgdorferi) by expanding the habitats of various common zoonotic disease-carrying vectors (e.g., Aedes albopictus mosquitos, ticks) (Caminade et al., 2019). The emergence of vector-borne pathogens in non-endemic regions often results in explosive epidemics. Land use due to increasing human population also affects the distribution of disease-carrying vectors (Kilpatrick and Randolph, 2012). Control of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens usually requires vector control to reverse the drivers of transmission.', 'Furthermore, the spread of several infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria, cholera) to extended geographic areas are now raising health concerns for a significant proportion of the population (Morens et al., 2004). These diseases show a wider spread as a result of the acquisition of drug resistance, tolerance of mosquito vector to insecticides, poor sanitation, land use and climate changes as well as increased in human mobility and travels (Cutler et al., 2010). Furthermore, outbreaks of cholera in regions where natural disasters occurred such as earthquakes and floods were also reported. Surveillance programs should be also implemented to control the spread of these pathogens from endemic to non-endemic regions.', 'Finally, infectious agents (e.g., Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, variola virus) could be used as bioweapons and could thus constitute threats for humanity (Oliveira et al., 2020). These weapons are based on natural microorganisms or microorganisms that are engineered to be more virulent, highly transmissible or resistant to therapy (Narayanan et al., 2018). The release of these biological weapons is intended to induce diseases in humans or even death. Therefore, governments should establish biowarfare, bioterrorism and biocrime preparedness plans to protect the population.', 'In this paper, we review major pandemics that have afflicted humankind throughout history such as plague, cholera, influenza and coronavirus diseases, the way they were controlled in the past and how these diseases are managed today. Infectious diseases still represent threats for human health as pathogens can spread rapidly through global trade and travels. Global surveillance programs are thus needed to detect and identify pathogens spillover from animals to humans as well as to control water-borne pathogens and vector-borne diseases. Furthermore, effective non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical measures for the prevention and control of these infections are required to limit their dissemination in the human population.', 'Plague is caused by the flea-borne bacteria Yersinia pestis that is responsible of at least three human plague pandemics, the plague of Justinian, the Black Death and the third plague (Table 1) (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). Y. pestis is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, coccobacillus bacteria. Y. pestis is a facultative anaerobic bacteria that is transmitted by fleas associated mainly to rodents and other mammalian hosts (Perry and Fetherston, 1997). Fleas acquire the bacteria by sucking blood from an infected rodent. Bacteria quickly multiply and block the alimentary canal in the gut of the fleas (Bacot and Martin, 1914). The fleas transmit the bacteria to new rodent hosts by regurgitating the clotted blood. Plague manifests in three forms, i.e., bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic, depending on the route of infection (Yang, 2018). The bubonic form is the most common and results from the bite of an infected flea. Clinical manifestations include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, body pains, weakness, vomiting and nausea followed by painful swollen lymph nodes. The bubonic form is likely to be fatal (50–90% of cases). Septicemic plague is rare (10–25% of cases) and consists of a progressive bloodstream infection in the absence of lymphadenopathy. The mortality rate is higher in patients with septicemic plague than in those with the bubonic form. Pneumonic plague occurs when the bacteria infects the lungs, either primarily by infectious respiratory droplets or secondarily as a complication of bubonic plague. This form is characterized by a fulminating onset and is rapidly fatal when left untreated.', 'The plague of Justinian occurred in Egypt and spread throughout the Eastern Roman Empire and its neighbors (Table 1) (Cunha and Cunha, 2008). Between 541 and 543, the plague killed an estimated 100 million people in the Roman Empire and especially in its capital, Constantinople. The highly developed structure of the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of the Justinian plague along its trade and military routes. In contrast, the plague did not affect the less organized barbarian societies outside of Rome’s borders. The high mortality caused by the disease might have contributed to the weakening and eventually to the decline of the Byzantine Empire. After this initial pandemic, intermittent plague outbreaks occurred every 8 to 12 years for two centuries and then disappeared for unknown reasons.', 'The identification of the causative pathogen involved in the death of victims of past pandemics usually relies on ancient DNA techniques aimed to directly extract DNA from skeletal remains. A great advance in paleomicrobiology techniques was the isolation of microbial DNA in dental pulp specimens (Drancourt et al., 1998). Indeed, bacteria are trapped in the dental pulp early in the course of a bacteremia and can be isolated from preserved teeth of victims. Therefore, analysis of the dental pulp is more efficient than bones to accurately identify microbial DNA from rapidly fatal infections that occurred in the past. Corpses of victims of the Justinian plague could be recovered in burial sites. Ancient DNA techniques from dental pulp samples identified Y. pestis as the etiological pathogen responsible for this pandemic (Harbeck et al., 2013).', 'The second plague pandemic, the Black Death, originated in East Asia and swept across Central Asia into Europe through the land and sea trade routes of the medieval Silk Road (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). The second plague pandemic lasted in Europe until the early of the 19th century and killed 200 million people. The lineages of Y. pestis that caused the plague of Justinian and the Black Death were independent emergences into human population (Wagner et al., 2014). The Black Death (1347–1351) killed as many as 30% of the European population and was followed by successive waves such as the plague of Milan (1630), the great plague of London (1665–1666) and the plague of Marseille (1720–1722). It is suggested that the bacteria may have persisted in rodent reservoirs in Europe and periodically re-emerged in the human population (Seifert et al., 2016). Another hypothesis could be that climate-driven outbreaks of Y. pestis in Asian rodent reservoirs were responsible for new waves of plague arriving into Europe through its maritime trade network with Asia (Schmid et al., 2015). The bacteria suddenly disappeared from Europe and this could be possibly related to the extinction of local rodent reservoirs (Spyrou et al., 2016). At that time, there was no effective treatment against plague. Initial institutional responses to disease control began during the Black Death (Tognotti, 2013). A sanitary cordon was imposed by armed guards along transit routes and at access points to cities. A separation between healthy and infected persons was accomplished in camps and then in permanent plague hospitals (called lazarettos). Port cities were closed to ships arriving from plague-infected areas. Ships with suspicion of plague were put in quarantine, passengers and crew were isolated in lazarettos and vessels were thoroughly fumigated and retained for 40 days. The Black Death decimated Medieval Europe and had major impacts on its socio-economic development, culture, art, religion and politics (Bramanti et al., 2016).', 'Based on genomic analysis of ancient and recent genomes, it was suggested that a wave of plague may have traveled from Europe to Asia after the Black Death, eventually setting in China and giving rise to the third plague pandemic (Spyrou et al., 2016). The latter plague pandemic originated in the middle of the 19th century in the Yunnan region (China), reached Canton and spread to Hong Kong (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). In 1894, Alexandre Yersin discovered the bacteria, Y. pestis, in specimens of plague patients and dead rats in Hong Kong (Yersin, 1894). The pandemic then reached Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and India via ships. Over the following years, plague became endemic in many countries around the world (Stenseth et al., 2008).', 'Since the 1990’s, plague is classified as a re-emerging infectious disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017a). Between 2010 and 2015, the number of plague cases was estimated at 3,248 with 584 fatalities worldwide, most of them occurring in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru (Glatter and Finkelman, 2020). In September 2017, a large outbreak of plague occurred in Madagascar with 2,417 cases among whom 77% were clinically suspected to have the pneumonic form (Mead, 2018). The basic reproduction number (Ro) was estimated at 1.73 (Tsuzuki et al., 2017). The case fatality rate was as high as 8.6% (Mead, 2018). Plague is seasonal in most endemic countries with a well-defined geographic distribution which corresponds to those of the vectors and rodent reservoirs (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Nowadays, plague should be considered as a neglected human threat due to its rapid spread, its high fatality rate without early treatment and its capacity to disrupt social and healthcare systems (Valles et al., 2020). The genetic plasticity of Y. pestis also suggests a potential risk for the emergence of antibiotic resistance (Radnedge et al., 2002). Surveillance and control programs of fleas and animals involved in the life cycle of Y. pestis are required in endemic regions. Individuals should protect themselves against flea bites in regions where plague is present. It is also recommended to avoid contact with infected body fluids and tissues as well as animal carcasses. Public health interventions that can be put in place to prevent or limit plague outbreaks include the killing of fleas with insecticides and, if required, the control of infected rodents; the early isolation of patients, the rapid diagnostic and treatment of infected individuals with antibiotics; the detection and isolation of contacts and the administration of chemoprophylaxis to exposed individuals (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Standard treatments against plague include streptomycin and doxycycline. Alternative drugs consist of gentamicin and fluoroquinolones (Butler, 2014; Yang, 2018). The WHO does not recommend vaccination except for health care workers and laboratory personnel who are highly exposed to the pathogen. Fifty years ago, a plague vaccine based on whole Y. pestis killed with formalin was approved in the United States. This vaccine was effective against bubonic plague but not against the pneumonic form of the disease. Furthermore, this vaccine was associated with a high reactogenicity. As highlighted in the Madagascar outbreak, Y. pestis can be responsible for pneumonic plague in a high number of cases. Furthermore, Y. pestis can be aerosolized for use as a bioweapon. Y. pestis is considered as a category A pathogen as it can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, cause high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impact (Ansari et al., 2020). Therefore, the development of a plague vaccine against the most deadly form of the disease is needed. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug designation to the recombinant F1 and V subunits vaccine (rF1V) that is intended as a prophylactic vaccine for individuals at high-risk of exposure to aerosolized Y. pestis. Several prophylactic and therapeutic plague vaccines are also being developed under the Plague Vaccine Target Product Profile (TPP) established by the WHO in 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018a). Vaccines under development include subunit, bacterial vector-based or viral vector-based vaccines expressing one or several antigens [F1 capsular protein, low calcium response protein V (LcrV), YscF and/or pesticin coagulase] of Y. pestis (Sun and Singh, 2019).', 'Cholera is an acute often fatal disease of the gastrointestinal tract caused by Vibrio cholerae (Faruque et al., 1998). V. cholerae is a gram-negative and coma-shaped bacteria. V. cholerae is a facultative anaerobe and has a flagellum at one cell pole as well as pili. The bacteria colonizes the small intestine and produces the cholera toxin which is responsible for a rapid and massive loss of body fluids leading to dehydration, hypovolemic shock and death. V. cholerae strains are classified based on their major lipopolysaccharide O antigens into approximately 206 serogroups of which serogroups O1 (consisting of two biotypes known as classical and El Tor) and O139 cause epidemic cholera (Chatterjee and Chaudhuri, 2006). V. cholerae is a water-borne pathogen. Humans are infected through contaminated water used for drinking or preparing foods. The infection is often mild or asymptomatic and bacteria are eliminated with feces in 1 or 2 weeks. V. cholerae persists indefinitely in aquatic reservoirs and may acquire mobile elements via horizontal gene transfer leading to the emergence of new toxigenic clones (Cho et al., 2010). V. cholerae are able to form a three-dimensional biofilm where the organisms can survive during inter-epidemic periods (Alam et al., 2007). Optimal growth conditions of bacteria in aquatic reservoirs include 15% salinity, 30°C water temperature and pH 8.5 that can be promoted by climate changes (Montilla et al., 1996).', 'Cholera was endemic in Asia until 1817, when a first pandemic spread from India to several other regions of the world (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). This pandemic emerged during a period of increasing globalization resulting from technological progress in transportation. Indeed, the advent of steamships and railways allowed a dramatic decrease in travel time and a rise in trade. At that time, health prevention strategies were essentially the same than those implemented during the Black Death (Tognotti, 2013). Infected persons were isolated in lazarettos. Port entry was forbidden for ships arriving from regions where cholera was present. Travelers who had contacts with infected persons or who came from a place where cholera was circulating were quarantined.', 'Thereafter, five additional major pandemics of cholera that originated from India and spread to other continents occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). The second and sixth pandemics, and presumably the other ones, were caused by the O1 classical biotype of V. cholerae (Devault et al., 2014; Siddique and Cash, 2014). The second pandemic of cholera reached the British islands. During the cholera outbreak in Soho (London), in 1854, the physician John Snow used for the first time epidemiological methods to trace the source of the outbreak. He described the time course of the outbreak and its geographical spread in the city. He identified the public pumps used for water supply in these areas and understood that water was the source of the contamination. He then proposed effective measures to prevent the transmission through the removal of pump handle in the city areas where the outbreak occurred (Smith, 2002). The bacillus of cholera was isolated during the fifth pandemic that extensively affected South America by Robert Koch (1884) who also understood the importance of clean water in preventing its transmission. The toxin responsible for the disease was only discovered in 1959 (De, 1959). The seventh cholera pandemic is the most extensive in terms of geographic spread and duration (Mutreja et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2016). It began in Indonesia in 1961 and became endemic in many regions of the world. It periodically caused major epidemics such as those in Zimbabwe (2008), Haiti (2010), Sierra Leone (2012), Mexico (2013), South Soudan and Ghana (2014) and Yemen (2016). Cholera epidemics usually ended because of a lack of favorable environmental conditions for the survival of vibrios. The seventh cholera pandemic was caused by El Tor biotype strain of V. cholerae that acquired virulence genes in the environment (Safa et al., 2010). In late 1992, the O139 serogroup caused a large cholera outbreak in Bangladesh and neighboring countries and raised the fear of a 8th cholera pandemic (Albert et al., 1993).', 'Cholera cannot be eradicated as it is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems. V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 are responsible for cholera outbreaks in developing countries. In 2019, 923,037 cases and 1,911 deaths were reported to WHO in 31 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020d). However, it is estimated that the global burden of cholera is higher due to underreporting. Between 2008 and 2012, the number of cases was shown to range between 1.3 and 4 millions per year with 95,000 deaths (Ali et al., 2015). Environmental and climate changes may increase the geographical distribution of cholera (Chowdhury et al., 2017). Furthermore, the emergence of environmental non-O1/O139 V. cholerae is increasing as genetic exchange mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer and genetic recombination are favored by changes in ecosystem and climate (Vezzulli et al., 2020). These non-O1/O139 vibrios can cause illness that can be mild (e.g., gastroenteritis, otitis) to life-threatening (necrotizing fasciitis) and could thus constitute a potential threat for humans. The persistence of cholera is related to poor living conditions including shortage of safe drinking water, insufficient sanitation, crowded housing and the lack of efficient sewage systems. Re-emergence of the disease can also occur following natural disasters such as earthquakes that disrupt access to safe water supply. Cholera outbreaks could be predicted based on real-time monitoring of oceanic regions, climate fluctuations and epidemiological surveillance program (Chowdhury et al., 2017). The disease could be prevented by implementation of public health measures to ensure adequate sanitation and safe water supply (Somboonwit et al., 2017). The access to safe drinking water and sanitation are among the primary priorities of the Millenium Development Goals and the sustainable Development Goals (Igere and Ekundayo, 2020). Furthermore, the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program launched by the WHO is central to the prevention of cholera transmission (Wolfe et al., 2018). Currently, three oral cholera vaccines were pre-qualified by the WHO (Dukoral®, SancholTM and Euvochol-Plus®). These vaccines should be used in areas with endemic cholera, cholera outbreaks and humanitarian crisis with high-risk of cholera in combination with other cholera prevention and control measures (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). Cholera is first identified based on clinical symptoms of severe acute watery diarrhea. The disease is then confirmed by the detection of V. cholerae in stool samples by culture, molecular testing or rapid diagnostic tests. The majority of infected individuals can be treated by the administration of prompt oral rehydration solution. Severely dehydrated patients who are at risk of shock require rapid administration of intravenous fluids as well as antibiotics. First-line drug consists of doxycycline whereas alternative treatments include tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin (Hsueh and Waters, 2019).', 'Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001). Their genome consists of 7 or 8 RNA segments encoding at least 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Structural proteins include a hemagglutinin (HA), a neuraminidase (NA), two matrix proteins and a nucleoprotein. Influenza viruses can be distinguished in types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are responsible for outbreaks in tropical regions and seasonal epidemics in temperate regions whereas influenza A viruses are the only ones with a pandemic potential (Lofgren et al., 2007). Indeed, influenza A virus is endemic in a number of species including humans, birds and pigs (Webster et al., 1992). Gene reassortments can thus occur between human and animal influenza A viruses and lead to a new virus subtype which can be pathogenic to humans (Webster et al., 1995).', 'In a typical seasonal epidemics, influenza virus causes 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide (Iuliano et al., 2018). Most typical seasonal influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or classical influenza illness characterized by 4 or 5 days of fever, cough, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness and sometimes upper respiratory tract symptoms (Zambon, 2001). Severe complications can occur especially in infants, elderly and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiac/pulmonary diseases. Among the most severe complications is pneumonia which can be associated with secondary bacterial infection.', 'Annual influenza epidemics are sustained in the human population through mutations occurring especially in the HA and NA viral surface glycoproteins, the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. Seasonal influenza virus results from frequent antigenic drifts every 2–5 years in response to selection pressure to evade human immunity (Kim et al., 2018). Its genome contains segmented genes which may undergo reassortments in cells co-infected with two or more influenza viruses. Each influenza A virus has a gene encoding for 1 of 16 possible HAs and another gene encoding for 1 of 9 possible NAs that are involved in viral attachment and release, respectively (Dugan et al., 2008). Of the 144 total combinatorial possibilities, only 3 HAs and 3 NAs in only 4 combinations (A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and possibly A/H3N8) were found to be truly adapted to humans. Rarely, antigenic shift which results from reassortment between human and animal viruses leads to the emergence of a new virus subtype (Webster et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2009). This antigenically distinct virus may have the ability to infect humans and achieve sustained human-to-human transmission and may cause a pandemic if the immunity in the human population is partial or lacking (Webster et al., 1992).', 'The time in which influenza virus began to infect humans or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but many historians agree that the first influenza pandemic could have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian flu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the first well-described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet (Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide (Table 1). The median Ro was estimated at 2.1 (interquartile range 1.9–2.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010). The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range 45–70%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in individuals aged 1–60 years and lower in infants and seniors (Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age (Valtat et al., 2011).', 'Twenty five years later, the Spanish flu was caused by an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic adaptation of an existing avian influenza virus to a new human host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identification, the virus spread silently around the world and its region of origin could not be determined. Analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from that time confirmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 influenza virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25–33% and the Ro was estimated at 2–3 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918–1919 pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month interval. The first wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918–1919 caused high mortality. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic influenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918–1919 pandemic showed a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young adults aged 20–40 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007) often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that the 1918 influenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis that was observed in 10–15% of cases (Shanks, 2015). The H1 hemagglutinin of the 1918–1919 pandemic virus was identified as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a strong pro-inflammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths occurred from several days to weeks (median 7–10 days) after the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and social distancing. However, these measures were implemented too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I. Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated the spread of the disease.', 'Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus were the cause of almost all seasonal influenza A epidemics worldwide. All influenza A viruses responsible for the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human, avian and swine influenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown in Figure 1.', 'The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957–1959 pandemic (Asian flu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase) by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the 1957–1959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case fatality rate was approximately 0.13% (Mc, 1958). The global mortality of the 1957–1959 influenza pandemic was estimated at 1–2 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases (Viboud et al., 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile range 1.53–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The highest attack rates were in school-age children through young adults up to 35 or 40 years of age (Serfling et al., 1967). Older adults, including those over the age of 60, had significantly lower attack rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults. Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation of the basal layer, limited inflammatory response and evidence of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al., 1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic agent had been identified (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In 1952, the WHO had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided information on the emergence and spread of the novel influenza virus. Containment measures (such as closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for a few weeks only. Influenza vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 53–60%) failed to have a significant impact on the pandemic due to inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009).', 'The 1968–1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989). The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that circulated in the human population since 1957. The global mortality rate of the 1968–1970 pandemic (Hong Kong flu) was estimated to be 0.5–2 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56–1.85) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62–65 years. The first pandemic season was more severe than the second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968–1970 influenza pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age groups and to the HA in the elderly. No specific containment measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977, a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978).', 'The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant made of influenza genes originating from human A/H3N2 (PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1, nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011). The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans, it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the population may be important to prevent future pandemics (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka, 2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed (Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The Ro was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-confirmed deaths. However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between 148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case fatality rate based on confirmed cases was 0.5% (Nishiura, 2010). Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at 0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality rates in younger populations affecting children, young adults and pregnant women were higher than in a typical influenza season. The average age of people who died with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009 pandemic was the first one to combine vaccines and antiviral use. Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine was approved only during the second wave, the immunization program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010). The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the influenza A/H3N2 continued to circulate.', 'Overall, the impacts of an influenza pandemic depend on the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age and past exposure to influenza viruses. The impacts of influenza are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics (Simonsen et al., 1998).', 'The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between influenza viruses in different species, including at the animal-human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases of human infections with avian influenza viruses also occurred with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al., 2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal influenza viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of influenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby complicating early detection and efficient control of potential outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent and control zoonotic influenza virus infections. Animal facilities must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness. To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9 influenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype of influenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019). Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2 virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the majority of the population has no protective immunity against the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010).', 'Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).', 'SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013).', 'Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed.', 'The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).', 'The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.', 'JP wrote the manuscript.

Y. pestis is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, coccobacillus bacteria. Y. pestis is a facultative anaerobic bacteria that is transmitted by fleas associated mainly to rodents and other mammalian hosts (Perry and Fetherston, 1997). Fleas acquire the bacteria by sucking blood from an infected rodent. Bacteria quickly multiply and block the alimentary canal in the gut of the fleas (Bacot and Martin, 1914). The fleas transmit the bacteria to new rodent hosts by regurgitating the clotted blood. Plague manifests in three forms, i.e., bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic, depending on the route of infection (Yang, 2018). The bubonic form is the most common and results from the bite of an infected flea. Clinical manifestations include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, body pains, weakness, vomiting and nausea followed by painful swollen lymph nodes. The bubonic form is likely to be fatal (50–90% of cases). Septicemic plague is rare (10–25% of cases) and consists of a progressive bloodstream infection in the absence of lymphadenopathy. The mortality rate is higher in patients with septicemic plague than in those with the bubonic form. Pneumonic plague occurs when the bacteria infects the lungs, either primarily by infectious respiratory droplets or secondarily as a complication of bubonic plague. This form is characterized by a fulminating onset and is rapidly fatal when left untreated.', 'The plague of Justinian occurred in Egypt and spread throughout the Eastern Roman Empire and its neighbors (Table 1) (Cunha and Cunha, 2008). Between 541 and 543, the plague killed an estimated 100 million people in the Roman Empire and especially in its capital, Constantinople. The highly developed structure of the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of the Justinian plague along its trade and military routes. In contrast, the plague did not affect the less organized barbarian societies outside of Rome’s borders. The high mortality caused by the disease might have contributed to the weakening and eventually to the decline of the Byzantine Empire. After this initial pandemic, intermittent plague outbreaks occurred every 8 to 12 years for two centuries and then disappeared for unknown reasons.', 'The identification of the causative pathogen involved in the death of victims of past pandemics usually relies on ancient DNA techniques aimed to directly extract DNA from skeletal remains. A great advance in paleomicrobiology techniques was the isolation of microbial DNA in dental pulp specimens (Drancourt et al., 1998). Indeed, bacteria are trapped in the dental pulp early in the course of a bacteremia and can be isolated from preserved teeth of victims. Therefore, analysis of the dental pulp is more efficient than bones to accurately identify microbial DNA from rapidly fatal infections that occurred in the past. Corpses of victims of the Justinian plague could be recovered in burial sites. Ancient DNA techniques from dental pulp samples identified Y. pestis as the etiological pathogen responsible for this pandemic (Harbeck et al., 2013).', 'The second plague pandemic, the Black Death, originated in East Asia and swept across Central Asia into Europe through the land and sea trade routes of the medieval Silk Road (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). The second plague pandemic lasted in Europe until the early of the 19th century and killed 200 million people. The lineages of Y. pestis that caused the plague of Justinian and the Black Death were independent emergences into human population (Wagner et al., 2014). The Black Death (1347–1351) killed as many as 30% of the European population and was followed by successive waves such as the plague of Milan (1630), the great plague of London (1665–1666) and the plague of Marseille (1720–1722). It is suggested that the bacteria may have persisted in rodent reservoirs in Europe and periodically re-emerged in the human population (Seifert et al., 2016). Another hypothesis could be that climate-driven outbreaks of Y. pestis in Asian rodent reservoirs were responsible for new waves of plague arriving into Europe through its maritime trade network with Asia (Schmid et al., 2015). The bacteria suddenly disappeared from Europe and this could be possibly related to the extinction of local rodent reservoirs (Spyrou et al., 2016). At that time, there was no effective treatment against plague. Initial institutional responses to disease control began during the Black Death (Tognotti, 2013). A sanitary cordon was imposed by armed guards along transit routes and at access points to cities. A separation between healthy and infected persons was accomplished in camps and then in permanent plague hospitals (called lazarettos). Port cities were closed to ships arriving from plague-infected areas. Ships with suspicion of plague were put in quarantine, passengers and crew were isolated in lazarettos and vessels were thoroughly fumigated and retained for 40 days. The Black Death decimated Medieval Europe and had major impacts on its socio-economic development, culture, art, religion and politics (Bramanti et al., 2016).', 'Based on genomic analysis of ancient and recent genomes, it was suggested that a wave of plague may have traveled from Europe to Asia after the Black Death, eventually setting in China and giving rise to the third plague pandemic (Spyrou et al., 2016). The latter plague pandemic originated in the middle of the 19th century in the Yunnan region (China), reached Canton and spread to Hong Kong (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). In 1894, Alexandre Yersin discovered the bacteria, Y. pestis, in specimens of plague patients and dead rats in Hong Kong (Yersin, 1894). The pandemic then reached Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and India via ships. Over the following years, plague became endemic in many countries around the world (Stenseth et al., 2008).', 'Since the 1990’s, plague is classified as a re-emerging infectious disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017a). Between 2010 and 2015, the number of plague cases was estimated at 3,248 with 584 fatalities worldwide, most of them occurring in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru (Glatter and Finkelman, 2020). In September 2017, a large outbreak of plague occurred in Madagascar with 2,417 cases among whom 77% were clinically suspected to have the pneumonic form (Mead, 2018). The basic reproduction number (Ro) was estimated at 1.73 (Tsuzuki et al., 2017). The case fatality rate was as high as 8.6% (Mead, 2018). Plague is seasonal in most endemic countries with a well-defined geographic distribution which corresponds to those of the vectors and rodent reservoirs (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Nowadays, plague should be considered as a neglected human threat due to its rapid spread, its high fatality rate without early treatment and its capacity to disrupt social and healthcare systems (Valles et al., 2020). The genetic plasticity of Y. pestis also suggests a potential risk for the emergence of antibiotic resistance (Radnedge et al., 2002). Surveillance and control programs of fleas and animals involved in the life cycle of Y. pestis are required in endemic regions. Individuals should protect themselves against flea bites in regions where plague is present. It is also recommended to avoid contact with infected body fluids and tissues as well as animal carcasses. Public health interventions that can be put in place to prevent or limit plague outbreaks include the killing of fleas with insecticides and, if required, the control of infected rodents; the early isolation of patients, the rapid diagnostic and treatment of infected individuals with antibiotics; the detection and isolation of contacts and the administration of chemoprophylaxis to exposed individuals (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Standard treatments against plague include streptomycin and doxycycline. Alternative drugs consist of gentamicin and fluoroquinolones (Butler, 2014; Yang, 2018). The WHO does not recommend vaccination except for health care workers and laboratory personnel who are highly exposed to the pathogen. Fifty years ago, a plague vaccine based on whole Y. pestis killed with formalin was approved in the United States. This vaccine was effective against bubonic plague but not against the pneumonic form of the disease. Furthermore, this vaccine was associated with a high reactogenicity. As highlighted in the Madagascar outbreak, Y. pestis can be responsible for pneumonic plague in a high number of cases. Furthermore, Y. pestis can be aerosolized for use as a bioweapon. Y. pestis is considered as a category A pathogen as it can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, cause high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impact (Ansari et al., 2020). Therefore, the development of a plague vaccine against the most deadly form of the disease is needed. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug designation to the recombinant F1 and V subunits vaccine (rF1V) that is intended as a prophylactic vaccine for individuals at high-risk of exposure to aerosolized Y. pestis. Several prophylactic and therapeutic plague vaccines are also being developed under the Plague Vaccine Target Product Profile (TPP) established by the WHO in 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018a). Vaccines under development include subunit, bacterial vector-based or viral vector-based vaccines expressing one or several antigens [F1 capsular protein, low calcium response protein V (LcrV), YscF and/or pesticin coagulase] of Y. pestis (Sun and Singh, 2019).', 'Cholera is an acute often fatal disease of the gastrointestinal tract caused by Vibrio cholerae (Faruque et al., 1998). V. cholerae is a gram-negative and coma-shaped bacteria. V. cholerae is a facultative anaerobe and has a flagellum at one cell pole as well as pili. The bacteria colonizes the small intestine and produces the cholera toxin which is responsible for a rapid and massive loss of body fluids leading to dehydration, hypovolemic shock and death. V. cholerae strains are classified based on their major lipopolysaccharide O antigens into approximately 206 serogroups of which serogroups O1 (consisting of two biotypes known as classical and El Tor) and O139 cause epidemic cholera (Chatterjee and Chaudhuri, 2006). V. cholerae is a water-borne pathogen. Humans are infected through contaminated water used for drinking or preparing foods. The infection is often mild or asymptomatic and bacteria are eliminated with feces in 1 or 2 weeks. V. cholerae persists indefinitely in aquatic reservoirs and may acquire mobile elements via horizontal gene transfer leading to the emergence of new toxigenic clones (Cho et al., 2010). V. cholerae are able to form a three-dimensional biofilm where the organisms can survive during inter-epidemic periods (Alam et al., 2007). Optimal growth conditions of bacteria in aquatic reservoirs include 15% salinity, 30°C water temperature and pH 8.5 that can be promoted by climate changes (Montilla et al., 1996).', 'Cholera was endemic in Asia until 1817, when a first pandemic spread from India to several other regions of the world (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). This pandemic emerged during a period of increasing globalization resulting from technological progress in transportation. Indeed, the advent of steamships and railways allowed a dramatic decrease in travel time and a rise in trade. At that time, health prevention strategies were essentially the same than those implemented during the Black Death (Tognotti, 2013). Infected persons were isolated in lazarettos. Port entry was forbidden for ships arriving from regions where cholera was present. Travelers who had contacts with infected persons or who came from a place where cholera was circulating were quarantined.', 'Thereafter, five additional major pandemics of cholera that originated from India and spread to other continents occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). The second and sixth pandemics, and presumably the other ones, were caused by the O1 classical biotype of V. cholerae (Devault et al., 2014; Siddique and Cash, 2014). The second pandemic of cholera reached the British islands. During the cholera outbreak in Soho (London), in 1854, the physician John Snow used for the first time epidemiological methods to trace the source of the outbreak. He described the time course of the outbreak and its geographical spread in the city. He identified the public pumps used for water supply in these areas and understood that water was the source of the contamination. He then proposed effective measures to prevent the transmission through the removal of pump handle in the city areas where the outbreak occurred (Smith, 2002). The bacillus of cholera was isolated during the fifth pandemic that extensively affected South America by Robert Koch (1884) who also understood the importance of clean water in preventing its transmission. The toxin responsible for the disease was only discovered in 1959 (De, 1959). The seventh cholera pandemic is the most extensive in terms of geographic spread and duration (Mutreja et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2016). It began in Indonesia in 1961 and became endemic in many regions of the world. It periodically caused major epidemics such as those in Zimbabwe (2008), Haiti (2010), Sierra Leone (2012), Mexico (2013), South Soudan and Ghana (2014) and Yemen (2016). Cholera epidemics usually ended because of a lack of favorable environmental conditions for the survival of vibrios. The seventh cholera pandemic was caused by El Tor biotype strain of V. cholerae that acquired virulence genes in the environment (Safa et al., 2010). In late 1992, the O139 serogroup caused a large cholera outbreak in Bangladesh and neighboring countries and raised the fear of a 8th cholera pandemic (Albert et al., 1993).', 'Cholera cannot be eradicated as it is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems. V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 are responsible for cholera outbreaks in developing countries. In 2019, 923,037 cases and 1,911 deaths were reported to WHO in 31 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020d). However, it is estimated that the global burden of cholera is higher due to underreporting. Between 2008 and 2012, the number of cases was shown to range between 1.3 and 4 millions per year with 95,000 deaths (Ali et al., 2015). Environmental and climate changes may increase the geographical distribution of cholera (Chowdhury et al., 2017). Furthermore, the emergence of environmental non-O1/O139 V. cholerae is increasing as genetic exchange mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer and genetic recombination are favored by changes in ecosystem and climate (Vezzulli et al., 2020). These non-O1/O139 vibrios can cause illness that can be mild (e.g., gastroenteritis, otitis) to life-threatening (necrotizing fasciitis) and could thus constitute a potential threat for humans. The persistence of cholera is related to poor living conditions including shortage of safe drinking water, insufficient sanitation, crowded housing and the lack of efficient sewage systems. Re-emergence of the disease can also occur following natural disasters such as earthquakes that disrupt access to safe water supply. Cholera outbreaks could be predicted based on real-time monitoring of oceanic regions, climate fluctuations and epidemiological surveillance program (Chowdhury et al., 2017). The disease could be prevented by implementation of public health measures to ensure adequate sanitation and safe water supply (Somboonwit et al., 2017). The access to safe drinking water and sanitation are among the primary priorities of the Millenium Development Goals and the sustainable Development Goals (Igere and Ekundayo, 2020). Furthermore, the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program launched by the WHO is central to the prevention of cholera transmission (Wolfe et al., 2018). Currently, three oral cholera vaccines were pre-qualified by the WHO (Dukoral®, SancholTM and Euvochol-Plus®). These vaccines should be used in areas with endemic cholera, cholera outbreaks and humanitarian crisis with high-risk of cholera in combination with other cholera prevention and control measures (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). Cholera is first identified based on clinical symptoms of severe acute watery diarrhea. The disease is then confirmed by the detection of V. cholerae in stool samples by culture, molecular testing or rapid diagnostic tests. The majority of infected individuals can be treated by the administration of prompt oral rehydration solution. Severely dehydrated patients who are at risk of shock require rapid administration of intravenous fluids as well as antibiotics. First-line drug consists of doxycycline whereas alternative treatments include tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin (Hsueh and Waters, 2019).', 'Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001). Their genome consists of 7 or 8 RNA segments encoding at least 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Structural proteins include a hemagglutinin (HA), a neuraminidase (NA), two matrix proteins and a nucleoprotein. Influenza viruses can be distinguished in types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are responsible for outbreaks in tropical regions and seasonal epidemics in temperate regions whereas influenza A viruses are the only ones with a pandemic potential (Lofgren et al., 2007). Indeed, influenza A virus is endemic in a number of species including humans, birds and pigs (Webster et al., 1992). Gene reassortments can thus occur between human and animal influenza A viruses and lead to a new virus subtype which can be pathogenic to humans (Webster et al., 1995).', 'In a typical seasonal epidemics, influenza virus causes 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide (Iuliano et al., 2018). Most typical seasonal influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or classical influenza illness characterized by 4 or 5 days of fever, cough, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness and sometimes upper respiratory tract symptoms (Zambon, 2001). Severe complications can occur especially in infants, elderly and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiac/pulmonary diseases. Among the most severe complications is pneumonia which can be associated with secondary bacterial infection.', 'Annual influenza epidemics are sustained in the human population through mutations occurring especially in the HA and NA viral surface glycoproteins, the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. Seasonal influenza virus results from frequent antigenic drifts every 2–5 years in response to selection pressure to evade human immunity (Kim et al., 2018). Its genome contains segmented genes which may undergo reassortments in cells co-infected with two or more influenza viruses. Each influenza A virus has a gene encoding for 1 of 16 possible HAs and another gene encoding for 1 of 9 possible NAs that are involved in viral attachment and release, respectively (Dugan et al., 2008). Of the 144 total combinatorial possibilities, only 3 HAs and 3 NAs in only 4 combinations (A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and possibly A/H3N8) were found to be truly adapted to humans. Rarely, antigenic shift which results from reassortment between human and animal viruses leads to the emergence of a new virus subtype (Webster et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2009). This antigenically distinct virus may have the ability to infect humans and achieve sustained human-to-human transmission and may cause a pandemic if the immunity in the human population is partial or lacking (Webster et al., 1992).', 'The time in which influenza virus began to infect humans or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but many historians agree that the first influenza pandemic could have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian flu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the first well-described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet (Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide (Table 1). The median Ro was estimated at 2.1 (interquartile range 1.9–2.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010). The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range 45–70%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in individuals aged 1–60 years and lower in infants and seniors (Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age (Valtat et al., 2011).', 'Twenty five years later, the Spanish flu was caused by an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic adaptation of an existing avian influenza virus to a new human host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identification, the virus spread silently around the world and its region of origin could not be determined. Analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from that time confirmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 influenza virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25–33% and the Ro was estimated at 2–3 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918–1919 pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month interval. The first wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918–1919 caused high mortality. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic influenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918–1919 pandemic showed a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young adults aged 20–40 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007) often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that the 1918 influenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis that was observed in 10–15% of cases (Shanks, 2015). The H1 hemagglutinin of the 1918–1919 pandemic virus was identified as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a strong pro-inflammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths occurred from several days to weeks (median 7–10 days) after the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and social distancing. However, these measures were implemented too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I. Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated the spread of the disease.', 'Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus were the cause of almost all seasonal influenza A epidemics worldwide. All influenza A viruses responsible for the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human, avian and swine influenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown in Figure 1.', 'The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957–1959 pandemic (Asian flu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase) by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the 1957–1959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case fatality rate was approximately 0.13% (Mc, 1958). The global mortality of the 1957–1959 influenza pandemic was estimated at 1–2 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases (Viboud et al., 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile range 1.53–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The highest attack rates were in school-age children through young adults up to 35 or 40 years of age (Serfling et al., 1967). Older adults, including those over the age of 60, had significantly lower attack rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults. Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation of the basal layer, limited inflammatory response and evidence of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al., 1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic agent had been identified (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In 1952, the WHO had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided information on the emergence and spread of the novel influenza virus. Containment measures (such as closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for a few weeks only. Influenza vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 53–60%) failed to have a significant impact on the pandemic due to inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009).', 'The 1968–1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989). The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that circulated in the human population since 1957. The global mortality rate of the 1968–1970 pandemic (Hong Kong flu) was estimated to be 0.5–2 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56–1.85) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62–65 years. The first pandemic season was more severe than the second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968–1970 influenza pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age groups and to the HA in the elderly. No specific containment measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977, a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978).', 'The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant made of influenza genes originating from human A/H3N2 (PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1, nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011). The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans, it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the population may be important to prevent future pandemics (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka, 2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed (Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The Ro was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-confirmed deaths. However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between 148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case fatality rate based on confirmed cases was 0.5% (Nishiura, 2010). Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at 0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality rates in younger populations affecting children, young adults and pregnant women were higher than in a typical influenza season. The average age of people who died with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009 pandemic was the first one to combine vaccines and antiviral use. Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine was approved only during the second wave, the immunization program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010). The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the influenza A/H3N2 continued to circulate.', 'Overall, the impacts of an influenza pandemic depend on the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age and past exposure to influenza viruses. The impacts of influenza are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics (Simonsen et al., 1998).', 'The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between influenza viruses in different species, including at the animal-human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases of human infections with avian influenza viruses also occurred with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al., 2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal influenza viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of influenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby complicating early detection and efficient control of potential outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent and control zoonotic influenza virus infections. Animal facilities must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness. To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9 influenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype of influenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019). Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2 virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the majority of the population has no protective immunity against the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010).', 'Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).', 'SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013).', 'Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed.', 'The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).', 'The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.', 'JP wrote the manuscript.

GB is the holder of the Canada research chair on emerging viruses and antiviral resistance.', 'The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.'], 'The Three Pandemics of Plague': ['The plague of Justinian occurred in Egypt and spread throughout the Eastern Roman Empire and its neighbors (Table 1) (Cunha and Cunha, 2008). Between 541 and 543, the plague killed an estimated 100 million people in the Roman Empire and especially in its capital, Constantinople. The highly developed structure of the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of the Justinian plague along its trade and military routes. In contrast, the plague did not affect the less organized barbarian societies outside of Rome’s borders. The high mortality caused by the disease might have contributed to the weakening and eventually to the decline of the Byzantine Empire. After this initial pandemic, intermittent plague outbreaks occurred every 8 to 12 years for two centuries and then disappeared for unknown reasons.', 'The identification of the causative pathogen involved in the death of victims of past pandemics usually relies on ancient DNA techniques aimed to directly extract DNA from skeletal remains. A great advance in paleomicrobiology techniques was the isolation of microbial DNA in dental pulp specimens (Drancourt et al., 1998). Indeed, bacteria are trapped in the dental pulp early in the course of a bacteremia and can be isolated from preserved teeth of victims. Therefore, analysis of the dental pulp is more efficient than bones to accurately identify microbial DNA from rapidly fatal infections that occurred in the past. Corpses of victims of the Justinian plague could be recovered in burial sites. Ancient DNA techniques from dental pulp samples identified Y. pestis as the etiological pathogen responsible for this pandemic (Harbeck et al., 2013).', 'The second plague pandemic, the Black Death, originated in East Asia and swept across Central Asia into Europe through the land and sea trade routes of the medieval Silk Road (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). The second plague pandemic lasted in Europe until the early of the 19th century and killed 200 million people. The lineages of Y. pestis that caused the plague of Justinian and the Black Death were independent emergences into human population (Wagner et al., 2014). The Black Death (1347–1351) killed as many as 30% of the European population and was followed by successive waves such as the plague of Milan (1630), the great plague of London (1665–1666) and the plague of Marseille (1720–1722). It is suggested that the bacteria may have persisted in rodent reservoirs in Europe and periodically re-emerged in the human population (Seifert et al., 2016). Another hypothesis could be that climate-driven outbreaks of Y. pestis in Asian rodent reservoirs were responsible for new waves of plague arriving into Europe through its maritime trade network with Asia (Schmid et al., 2015). The bacteria suddenly disappeared from Europe and this could be possibly related to the extinction of local rodent reservoirs (Spyrou et al., 2016). At that time, there was no effective treatment against plague. Initial institutional responses to disease control began during the Black Death (Tognotti, 2013). A sanitary cordon was imposed by armed guards along transit routes and at access points to cities. A separation between healthy and infected persons was accomplished in camps and then in permanent plague hospitals (called lazarettos). Port cities were closed to ships arriving from plague-infected areas. Ships with suspicion of plague were put in quarantine, passengers and crew were isolated in lazarettos and vessels were thoroughly fumigated and retained for 40 days. The Black Death decimated Medieval Europe and had major impacts on its socio-economic development, culture, art, religion and politics (Bramanti et al., 2016).', 'Based on genomic analysis of ancient and recent genomes, it was suggested that a wave of plague may have traveled from Europe to Asia after the Black Death, eventually setting in China and giving rise to the third plague pandemic (Spyrou et al., 2016). The latter plague pandemic originated in the middle of the 19th century in the Yunnan region (China), reached Canton and spread to Hong Kong (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004). In 1894, Alexandre Yersin discovered the bacteria, Y. pestis, in specimens of plague patients and dead rats in Hong Kong (Yersin, 1894). The pandemic then reached Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and India via ships. Over the following years, plague became endemic in many countries around the world (Stenseth et al., 2008).', 'Since the 1990’s, plague is classified as a re-emerging infectious disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017a). Between 2010 and 2015, the number of plague cases was estimated at 3,248 with 584 fatalities worldwide, most of them occurring in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru (Glatter and Finkelman, 2020). In September 2017, a large outbreak of plague occurred in Madagascar with 2,417 cases among whom 77% were clinically suspected to have the pneumonic form (Mead, 2018). The basic reproduction number (Ro) was estimated at 1.73 (Tsuzuki et al., 2017). The case fatality rate was as high as 8.6% (Mead, 2018). Plague is seasonal in most endemic countries with a well-defined geographic distribution which corresponds to those of the vectors and rodent reservoirs (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Nowadays, plague should be considered as a neglected human threat due to its rapid spread, its high fatality rate without early treatment and its capacity to disrupt social and healthcare systems (Valles et al., 2020). The genetic plasticity of Y. pestis also suggests a potential risk for the emergence of antibiotic resistance (Radnedge et al., 2002). Surveillance and control programs of fleas and animals involved in the life cycle of Y. pestis are required in endemic regions. Individuals should protect themselves against flea bites in regions where plague is present. It is also recommended to avoid contact with infected body fluids and tissues as well as animal carcasses. Public health interventions that can be put in place to prevent or limit plague outbreaks include the killing of fleas with insecticides and, if required, the control of infected rodents; the early isolation of patients, the rapid diagnostic and treatment of infected individuals with antibiotics; the detection and isolation of contacts and the administration of chemoprophylaxis to exposed individuals (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Standard treatments against plague include streptomycin and doxycycline. Alternative drugs consist of gentamicin and fluoroquinolones (Butler, 2014; Yang, 2018). The WHO does not recommend vaccination except for health care workers and laboratory personnel who are highly exposed to the pathogen. Fifty years ago, a plague vaccine based on whole Y. pestis killed with formalin was approved in the United States. This vaccine was effective against bubonic plague but not against the pneumonic form of the disease. Furthermore, this vaccine was associated with a high reactogenicity. As highlighted in the Madagascar outbreak, Y. pestis can be responsible for pneumonic plague in a high number of cases. Furthermore, Y. pestis can be aerosolized for use as a bioweapon. Y. pestis is considered as a category A pathogen as it can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, cause high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impact (Ansari et al., 2020). Therefore, the development of a plague vaccine against the most deadly form of the disease is needed. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug designation to the recombinant F1 and V subunits vaccine (rF1V) that is intended as a prophylactic vaccine for individuals at high-risk of exposure to aerosolized Y. pestis. Several prophylactic and therapeutic plague vaccines are also being developed under the Plague Vaccine Target Product Profile (TPP) established by the WHO in 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018a). Vaccines under development include subunit, bacterial vector-based or viral vector-based vaccines expressing one or several antigens [F1 capsular protein, low calcium response protein V (LcrV), YscF and/or pesticin coagulase] of Y. pestis (Sun and Singh, 2019).', 'Cholera is an acute often fatal disease of the gastrointestinal tract caused by Vibrio cholerae (Faruque et al., 1998). V. cholerae is a gram-negative and coma-shaped bacteria. V. cholerae is a facultative anaerobe and has a flagellum at one cell pole as well as pili. The bacteria colonizes the small intestine and produces the cholera toxin which is responsible for a rapid and massive loss of body fluids leading to dehydration, hypovolemic shock and death. V. cholerae strains are classified based on their major lipopolysaccharide O antigens into approximately 206 serogroups of which serogroups O1 (consisting of two biotypes known as classical and El Tor) and O139 cause epidemic cholera (Chatterjee and Chaudhuri, 2006). V. cholerae is a water-borne pathogen. Humans are infected through contaminated water used for drinking or preparing foods. The infection is often mild or asymptomatic and bacteria are eliminated with feces in 1 or 2 weeks. V. cholerae persists indefinitely in aquatic reservoirs and may acquire mobile elements via horizontal gene transfer leading to the emergence of new toxigenic clones (Cho et al., 2010). V. cholerae are able to form a three-dimensional biofilm where the organisms can survive during inter-epidemic periods (Alam et al., 2007). Optimal growth conditions of bacteria in aquatic reservoirs include 15% salinity, 30°C water temperature and pH 8.5 that can be promoted by climate changes (Montilla et al., 1996).', 'Cholera was endemic in Asia until 1817, when a first pandemic spread from India to several other regions of the world (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). This pandemic emerged during a period of increasing globalization resulting from technological progress in transportation. Indeed, the advent of steamships and railways allowed a dramatic decrease in travel time and a rise in trade. At that time, health prevention strategies were essentially the same than those implemented during the Black Death (Tognotti, 2013). Infected persons were isolated in lazarettos. Port entry was forbidden for ships arriving from regions where cholera was present. Travelers who had contacts with infected persons or who came from a place where cholera was circulating were quarantined.', 'Thereafter, five additional major pandemics of cholera that originated from India and spread to other continents occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). The second and sixth pandemics, and presumably the other ones, were caused by the O1 classical biotype of V. cholerae (Devault et al., 2014; Siddique and Cash, 2014). The second pandemic of cholera reached the British islands. During the cholera outbreak in Soho (London), in 1854, the physician John Snow used for the first time epidemiological methods to trace the source of the outbreak. He described the time course of the outbreak and its geographical spread in the city. He identified the public pumps used for water supply in these areas and understood that water was the source of the contamination. He then proposed effective measures to prevent the transmission through the removal of pump handle in the city areas where the outbreak occurred (Smith, 2002). The bacillus of cholera was isolated during the fifth pandemic that extensively affected South America by Robert Koch (1884) who also understood the importance of clean water in preventing its transmission. The toxin responsible for the disease was only discovered in 1959 (De, 1959). The seventh cholera pandemic is the most extensive in terms of geographic spread and duration (Mutreja et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2016). It began in Indonesia in 1961 and became endemic in many regions of the world. It periodically caused major epidemics such as those in Zimbabwe (2008), Haiti (2010), Sierra Leone (2012), Mexico (2013), South Soudan and Ghana (2014) and Yemen (2016). Cholera epidemics usually ended because of a lack of favorable environmental conditions for the survival of vibrios. The seventh cholera pandemic was caused by El Tor biotype strain of V. cholerae that acquired virulence genes in the environment (Safa et al., 2010). In late 1992, the O139 serogroup caused a large cholera outbreak in Bangladesh and neighboring countries and raised the fear of a 8th cholera pandemic (Albert et al., 1993).', 'Cholera cannot be eradicated as it is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems. V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 are responsible for cholera outbreaks in developing countries. In 2019, 923,037 cases and 1,911 deaths were reported to WHO in 31 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020d). However, it is estimated that the global burden of cholera is higher due to underreporting. Between 2008 and 2012, the number of cases was shown to range between 1.3 and 4 millions per year with 95,000 deaths (Ali et al., 2015). Environmental and climate changes may increase the geographical distribution of cholera (Chowdhury et al., 2017). Furthermore, the emergence of environmental non-O1/O139 V. cholerae is increasing as genetic exchange mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer and genetic recombination are favored by changes in ecosystem and climate (Vezzulli et al., 2020). These non-O1/O139 vibrios can cause illness that can be mild (e.g., gastroenteritis, otitis) to life-threatening (necrotizing fasciitis) and could thus constitute a potential threat for humans. The persistence of cholera is related to poor living conditions including shortage of safe drinking water, insufficient sanitation, crowded housing and the lack of efficient sewage systems. Re-emergence of the disease can also occur following natural disasters such as earthquakes that disrupt access to safe water supply. Cholera outbreaks could be predicted based on real-time monitoring of oceanic regions, climate fluctuations and epidemiological surveillance program (Chowdhury et al., 2017). The disease could be prevented by implementation of public health measures to ensure adequate sanitation and safe water supply (Somboonwit et al., 2017). The access to safe drinking water and sanitation are among the primary priorities of the Millenium Development Goals and the sustainable Development Goals (Igere and Ekundayo, 2020). Furthermore, the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program launched by the WHO is central to the prevention of cholera transmission (Wolfe et al., 2018). Currently, three oral cholera vaccines were pre-qualified by the WHO (Dukoral®, SancholTM and Euvochol-Plus®). These vaccines should be used in areas with endemic cholera, cholera outbreaks and humanitarian crisis with high-risk of cholera in combination with other cholera prevention and control measures (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). Cholera is first identified based on clinical symptoms of severe acute watery diarrhea. The disease is then confirmed by the detection of V. cholerae in stool samples by culture, molecular testing or rapid diagnostic tests. The majority of infected individuals can be treated by the administration of prompt oral rehydration solution. Severely dehydrated patients who are at risk of shock require rapid administration of intravenous fluids as well as antibiotics. First-line drug consists of doxycycline whereas alternative treatments include tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin (Hsueh and Waters, 2019).', 'Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001). Their genome consists of 7 or 8 RNA segments encoding at least 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Structural proteins include a hemagglutinin (HA), a neuraminidase (NA), two matrix proteins and a nucleoprotein. Influenza viruses can be distinguished in types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are responsible for outbreaks in tropical regions and seasonal epidemics in temperate regions whereas influenza A viruses are the only ones with a pandemic potential (Lofgren et al., 2007). Indeed, influenza A virus is endemic in a number of species including humans, birds and pigs (Webster et al., 1992). Gene reassortments can thus occur between human and animal influenza A viruses and lead to a new virus subtype which can be pathogenic to humans (Webster et al., 1995).', 'In a typical seasonal epidemics, influenza virus causes 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide (Iuliano et al., 2018). Most typical seasonal influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or classical influenza illness characterized by 4 or 5 days of fever, cough, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness and sometimes upper respiratory tract symptoms (Zambon, 2001). Severe complications can occur especially in infants, elderly and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiac/pulmonary diseases. Among the most severe complications is pneumonia which can be associated with secondary bacterial infection.', 'Annual influenza epidemics are sustained in the human population through mutations occurring especially in the HA and NA viral surface glycoproteins, the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. Seasonal influenza virus results from frequent antigenic drifts every 2–5 years in response to selection pressure to evade human immunity (Kim et al., 2018). Its genome contains segmented genes which may undergo reassortments in cells co-infected with two or more influenza viruses. Each influenza A virus has a gene encoding for 1 of 16 possible HAs and another gene encoding for 1 of 9 possible NAs that are involved in viral attachment and release, respectively (Dugan et al., 2008). Of the 144 total combinatorial possibilities, only 3 HAs and 3 NAs in only 4 combinations (A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and possibly A/H3N8) were found to be truly adapted to humans. Rarely, antigenic shift which results from reassortment between human and animal viruses leads to the emergence of a new virus subtype (Webster et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2009). This antigenically distinct virus may have the ability to infect humans and achieve sustained human-to-human transmission and may cause a pandemic if the immunity in the human population is partial or lacking (Webster et al., 1992).', 'The time in which influenza virus began to infect humans or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but many historians agree that the first influenza pandemic could have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian flu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the first well-described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet (Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide (Table 1). The median Ro was estimated at 2.1 (interquartile range 1.9–2.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010). The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range 45–70%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in individuals aged 1–60 years and lower in infants and seniors (Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age (Valtat et al., 2011).', 'Twenty five years later, the Spanish flu was caused by an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic adaptation of an existing avian influenza virus to a new human host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identification, the virus spread silently around the world and its region of origin could not be determined. Analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from that time confirmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 influenza virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25–33% and the Ro was estimated at 2–3 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918–1919 pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month interval. The first wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918–1919 caused high mortality. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic influenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918–1919 pandemic showed a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young adults aged 20–40 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007) often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that the 1918 influenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis that was observed in 10–15% of cases (Shanks, 2015). The H1 hemagglutinin of the 1918–1919 pandemic virus was identified as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a strong pro-inflammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths occurred from several days to weeks (median 7–10 days) after the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and social distancing. However, these measures were implemented too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I. Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated the spread of the disease.', 'Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus were the cause of almost all seasonal influenza A epidemics worldwide. All influenza A viruses responsible for the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human, avian and swine influenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown in Figure 1.', 'The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957–1959 pandemic (Asian flu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase) by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the 1957–1959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case fatality rate was approximately 0.13% (Mc, 1958). The global mortality of the 1957–1959 influenza pandemic was estimated at 1–2 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases (Viboud et al., 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile range 1.53–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The highest attack rates were in school-age children through young adults up to 35 or 40 years of age (Serfling et al., 1967). Older adults, including those over the age of 60, had significantly lower attack rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults. Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation of the basal layer, limited inflammatory response and evidence of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al., 1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic agent had been identified (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In 1952, the WHO had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided information on the emergence and spread of the novel influenza virus. Containment measures (such as closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for a few weeks only. Influenza vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 53–60%) failed to have a significant impact on the pandemic due to inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009).', 'The 1968–1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989). The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that circulated in the human population since 1957. The global mortality rate of the 1968–1970 pandemic (Hong Kong flu) was estimated to be 0.5–2 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56–1.85) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62–65 years. The first pandemic season was more severe than the second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968–1970 influenza pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age groups and to the HA in the elderly. No specific containment measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977, a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978).', 'The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant made of influenza genes originating from human A/H3N2 (PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1, nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011). The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans, it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the population may be important to prevent future pandemics (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka, 2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed (Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The Ro was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-confirmed deaths. However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between 148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case fatality rate based on confirmed cases was 0.5% (Nishiura, 2010). Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at 0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality rates in younger populations affecting children, young adults and pregnant women were higher than in a typical influenza season. The average age of people who died with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009 pandemic was the first one to combine vaccines and antiviral use. Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine was approved only during the second wave, the immunization program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010). The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the influenza A/H3N2 continued to circulate.', 'Overall, the impacts of an influenza pandemic depend on the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age and past exposure to influenza viruses. The impacts of influenza are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics (Simonsen et al., 1998).', 'The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between influenza viruses in different species, including at the animal-human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases of human infections with avian influenza viruses also occurred with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al., 2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal influenza viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of influenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby complicating early detection and efficient control of potential outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent and control zoonotic influenza virus infections. Animal facilities must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness. To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9 influenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype of influenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019). Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2 virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the majority of the population has no protective immunity against the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010).', 'Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).', 'SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013).', 'Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed.', 'The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).', 'The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.', 'JP wrote the manuscript. GB revised the manuscript.

GB is the holder of the Canada research chair on emerging viruses and antiviral resistance.', 'The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.'], 'The Plague Nowadays': ['Since the 1990’s, plague is classified as a re-emerging infectious disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017a). Between 2010 and 2015, the number of plague cases was estimated at 3,248 with 584 fatalities worldwide, most of them occurring in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru (Glatter and Finkelman, 2020). In September 2017, a large outbreak of plague occurred in Madagascar with 2,417 cases among whom 77% were clinically suspected to have the pneumonic form (Mead, 2018). The basic reproduction number (Ro) was estimated at 1.73 (Tsuzuki et al., 2017). The case fatality rate was as high as 8.6% (Mead, 2018). Plague is seasonal in most endemic countries with a well-defined geographic distribution which corresponds to those of the vectors and rodent reservoirs (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Nowadays, plague should be considered as a neglected human threat due to its rapid spread, its high fatality rate without early treatment and its capacity to disrupt social and healthcare systems (Valles et al., 2020). The genetic plasticity of Y. pestis also suggests a potential risk for the emergence of antibiotic resistance (Radnedge et al., 2002). Surveillance and control programs of fleas and animals involved in the life cycle of Y. pestis are required in endemic regions. Individuals should protect themselves against flea bites in regions where plague is present. It is also recommended to avoid contact with infected body fluids and tissues as well as animal carcasses. Public health interventions that can be put in place to prevent or limit plague outbreaks include the killing of fleas with insecticides and, if required, the control of infected rodents; the early isolation of patients, the rapid diagnostic and treatment of infected individuals with antibiotics; the detection and isolation of contacts and the administration of chemoprophylaxis to exposed individuals (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Standard treatments against plague include streptomycin and doxycycline. Alternative drugs consist of gentamicin and fluoroquinolones (Butler, 2014; Yang, 2018). The WHO does not recommend vaccination except for health care workers and laboratory personnel who are highly exposed to the pathogen. Fifty years ago, a plague vaccine based on whole Y. pestis killed with formalin was approved in the United States. This vaccine was effective against bubonic plague but not against the pneumonic form of the disease. Furthermore, this vaccine was associated with a high reactogenicity. As highlighted in the Madagascar outbreak, Y. pestis can be responsible for pneumonic plague in a high number of cases. Furthermore, Y. pestis can be aerosolized for use as a bioweapon. Y. pestis is considered as a category A pathogen as it can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, cause high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impact (Ansari et al., 2020). Therefore, the development of a plague vaccine against the most deadly form of the disease is needed. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug designation to the recombinant F1 and V subunits vaccine (rF1V) that is intended as a prophylactic vaccine for individuals at high-risk of exposure to aerosolized Y. pestis. Several prophylactic and therapeutic plague vaccines are also being developed under the Plague Vaccine Target Product Profile (TPP) established by the WHO in 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018a). Vaccines under development include subunit, bacterial vector-based or viral vector-based vaccines expressing one or several antigens [F1 capsular protein, low calcium response protein V (LcrV), YscF and/or pesticin coagulase] of Y. pestis (Sun and Singh, 2019).', 'Cholera is an acute often fatal disease of the gastrointestinal tract caused by Vibrio cholerae (Faruque et al., 1998). V. cholerae is a gram-negative and coma-shaped bacteria. V. cholerae is a facultative anaerobe and has a flagellum at one cell pole as well as pili. The bacteria colonizes the small intestine and produces the cholera toxin which is responsible for a rapid and massive loss of body fluids leading to dehydration, hypovolemic shock and death. V. cholerae strains are classified based on their major lipopolysaccharide O antigens into approximately 206 serogroups of which serogroups O1 (consisting of two biotypes known as classical and El Tor) and O139 cause epidemic cholera (Chatterjee and Chaudhuri, 2006). V. cholerae is a water-borne pathogen. Humans are infected through contaminated water used for drinking or preparing foods. The infection is often mild or asymptomatic and bacteria are eliminated with feces in 1 or 2 weeks. V. cholerae persists indefinitely in aquatic reservoirs and may acquire mobile elements via horizontal gene transfer leading to the emergence of new toxigenic clones (Cho et al., 2010). V. cholerae are able to form a three-dimensional biofilm where the organisms can survive during inter-epidemic periods (Alam et al., 2007). Optimal growth conditions of bacteria in aquatic reservoirs include 15% salinity, 30°C water temperature and pH 8.5 that can be promoted by climate changes (Montilla et al., 1996).', 'Cholera was endemic in Asia until 1817, when a first pandemic spread from India to several other regions of the world (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). This pandemic emerged during a period of increasing globalization resulting from technological progress in transportation. Indeed, the advent of steamships and railways allowed a dramatic decrease in travel time and a rise in trade. At that time, health prevention strategies were essentially the same than those implemented during the Black Death (Tognotti, 2013). Infected persons were isolated in lazarettos. Port entry was forbidden for ships arriving from regions where cholera was present. Travelers who had contacts with infected persons or who came from a place where cholera was circulating were quarantined.', 'Thereafter, five additional major pandemics of cholera that originated from India and spread to other continents occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). The second and sixth pandemics, and presumably the other ones, were caused by the O1 classical biotype of V. cholerae (Devault et al., 2014; Siddique and Cash, 2014). The second pandemic of cholera reached the British islands. During the cholera outbreak in Soho (London), in 1854, the physician John Snow used for the first time epidemiological methods to trace the source of the outbreak. He described the time course of the outbreak and its geographical spread in the city. He identified the public pumps used for water supply in these areas and understood that water was the source of the contamination. He then proposed effective measures to prevent the transmission through the removal of pump handle in the city areas where the outbreak occurred (Smith, 2002). The bacillus of cholera was isolated during the fifth pandemic that extensively affected South America by Robert Koch (1884) who also understood the importance of clean water in preventing its transmission. The toxin responsible for the disease was only discovered in 1959 (De, 1959). The seventh cholera pandemic is the most extensive in terms of geographic spread and duration (Mutreja et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2016). It began in Indonesia in 1961 and became endemic in many regions of the world. It periodically caused major epidemics such as those in Zimbabwe (2008), Haiti (2010), Sierra Leone (2012), Mexico (2013), South Soudan and Ghana (2014) and Yemen (2016). Cholera epidemics usually ended because of a lack of favorable environmental conditions for the survival of vibrios. The seventh cholera pandemic was caused by El Tor biotype strain of V. cholerae that acquired virulence genes in the environment (Safa et al., 2010). In late 1992, the O139 serogroup caused a large cholera outbreak in Bangladesh and neighboring countries and raised the fear of a 8th cholera pandemic (Albert et al., 1993).', 'Cholera cannot be eradicated as it is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems. V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 are responsible for cholera outbreaks in developing countries. In 2019, 923,037 cases and 1,911 deaths were reported to WHO in 31 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020d). However, it is estimated that the global burden of cholera is higher due to underreporting. Between 2008 and 2012, the number of cases was shown to range between 1.3 and 4 millions per year with 95,000 deaths (Ali et al., 2015). Environmental and climate changes may increase the geographical distribution of cholera (Chowdhury et al., 2017). Furthermore, the emergence of environmental non-O1/O139 V. cholerae is increasing as genetic exchange mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer and genetic recombination are favored by changes in ecosystem and climate (Vezzulli et al., 2020). These non-O1/O139 vibrios can cause illness that can be mild (e.g., gastroenteritis, otitis) to life-threatening (necrotizing fasciitis) and could thus constitute a potential threat for humans. The persistence of cholera is related to poor living conditions including shortage of safe drinking water, insufficient sanitation, crowded housing and the lack of efficient sewage systems. Re-emergence of the disease can also occur following natural disasters such as earthquakes that disrupt access to safe water supply. Cholera outbreaks could be predicted based on real-time monitoring of oceanic regions, climate fluctuations and epidemiological surveillance program (Chowdhury et al., 2017). The disease could be prevented by implementation of public health measures to ensure adequate sanitation and safe water supply (Somboonwit et al., 2017). The access to safe drinking water and sanitation are among the primary priorities of the Millenium Development Goals and the sustainable Development Goals (Igere and Ekundayo, 2020). Furthermore, the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program launched by the WHO is central to the prevention of cholera transmission (Wolfe et al., 2018). Currently, three oral cholera vaccines were pre-qualified by the WHO (Dukoral®, SancholTM and Euvochol-Plus®). These vaccines should be used in areas with endemic cholera, cholera outbreaks and humanitarian crisis with high-risk of cholera in combination with other cholera prevention and control measures (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). Cholera is first identified based on clinical symptoms of severe acute watery diarrhea. The disease is then confirmed by the detection of V. cholerae in stool samples by culture, molecular testing or rapid diagnostic tests. The majority of infected individuals can be treated by the administration of prompt oral rehydration solution. Severely dehydrated patients who are at risk of shock require rapid administration of intravenous fluids as well as antibiotics. First-line drug consists of doxycycline whereas alternative treatments include tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin (Hsueh and Waters, 2019).', 'Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001). Their genome consists of 7 or 8 RNA segments encoding at least 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Structural proteins include a hemagglutinin (HA), a neuraminidase (NA), two matrix proteins and a nucleoprotein. Influenza viruses can be distinguished in types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are responsible for outbreaks in tropical regions and seasonal epidemics in temperate regions whereas influenza A viruses are the only ones with a pandemic potential (Lofgren et al., 2007). Indeed, influenza A virus is endemic in a number of species including humans, birds and pigs (Webster et al., 1992). Gene reassortments can thus occur between human and animal influenza A viruses and lead to a new virus subtype which can be pathogenic to humans (Webster et al., 1995).', 'In a typical seasonal epidemics, influenza virus causes 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide (Iuliano et al., 2018). Most typical seasonal influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or classical influenza illness characterized by 4 or 5 days of fever, cough, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness and sometimes upper respiratory tract symptoms (Zambon, 2001). Severe complications can occur especially in infants, elderly and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiac/pulmonary diseases. Among the most severe complications is pneumonia which can be associated with secondary bacterial infection.', 'Annual influenza epidemics are sustained in the human population through mutations occurring especially in the HA and NA viral surface glycoproteins, the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. Seasonal influenza virus results from frequent antigenic drifts every 2–5 years in response to selection pressure to evade human immunity (Kim et al., 2018). Its genome contains segmented genes which may undergo reassortments in cells co-infected with two or more influenza viruses. Each influenza A virus has a gene encoding for 1 of 16 possible HAs and another gene encoding for 1 of 9 possible NAs that are involved in viral attachment and release, respectively (Dugan et al., 2008). Of the 144 total combinatorial possibilities, only 3 HAs and 3 NAs in only 4 combinations (A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and possibly A/H3N8) were found to be truly adapted to humans. Rarely, antigenic shift which results from reassortment between human and animal viruses leads to the emergence of a new virus subtype (Webster et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2009). This antigenically distinct virus may have the ability to infect humans and achieve sustained human-to-human transmission and may cause a pandemic if the immunity in the human population is partial or lacking (Webster et al., 1992).', 'The time in which influenza virus began to infect humans or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but many historians agree that the first influenza pandemic could have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian flu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the first well-described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet (Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide (Table 1). The median Ro was estimated at 2.1 (interquartile range 1.9–2.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010). The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range 45–70%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in individuals aged 1–60 years and lower in infants and seniors (Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age (Valtat et al., 2011).', 'Twenty five years later, the Spanish flu was caused by an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic adaptation of an existing avian influenza virus to a new human host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identification, the virus spread silently around the world and its region of origin could not be determined. Analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from that time confirmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 influenza virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25–33% and the Ro was estimated at 2–3 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918–1919 pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month interval. The first wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918–1919 caused high mortality. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic influenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918–1919 pandemic showed a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young adults aged 20–40 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007) often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that the 1918 influenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis that was observed in 10–15% of cases (Shanks, 2015). The H1 hemagglutinin of the 1918–1919 pandemic virus was identified as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a strong pro-inflammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths occurred from several days to weeks (median 7–10 days) after the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and social distancing. However, these measures were implemented too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I. Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated the spread of the disease.', 'Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus were the cause of almost all seasonal influenza A epidemics worldwide. All influenza A viruses responsible for the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human, avian and swine influenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown in Figure 1.', 'The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957–1959 pandemic (Asian flu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase) by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the 1957–1959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case fatality rate was approximately 0.13% (Mc, 1958). The global mortality of the 1957–1959 influenza pandemic was estimated at 1–2 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases (Viboud et al., 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile range 1.53–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The highest attack rates were in school-age children through young adults up to 35 or 40 years of age (Serfling et al., 1967). Older adults, including those over the age of 60, had significantly lower attack rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults. Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation of the basal layer, limited inflammatory response and evidence of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al., 1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic agent had been identified (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In 1952, the WHO had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided information on the emergence and spread of the novel influenza virus. Containment measures (such as closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for a few weeks only. Influenza vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 53–60%) failed to have a significant impact on the pandemic due to inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009).', 'The 1968–1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989). The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that circulated in the human population since 1957. The global mortality rate of the 1968–1970 pandemic (Hong Kong flu) was estimated to be 0.5–2 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56–1.85) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62–65 years. The first pandemic season was more severe than the second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968–1970 influenza pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age groups and to the HA in the elderly. No specific containment measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977, a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978).', 'The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant made of influenza genes originating from human A/H3N2 (PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1, nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011). The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans, it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the population may be important to prevent future pandemics (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka, 2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed (Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The Ro was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-confirmed deaths. However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between 148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case fatality rate based on confirmed cases was 0.5% (Nishiura, 2010). Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at 0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality rates in younger populations affecting children, young adults and pregnant women were higher than in a typical influenza season. The average age of people who died with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009 pandemic was the first one to combine vaccines and antiviral use. Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine was approved only during the second wave, the immunization program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010). The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the influenza A/H3N2 continued to circulate.', 'Overall, the impacts of an influenza pandemic depend on the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age and past exposure to influenza viruses. The impacts of influenza are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics (Simonsen et al., 1998).', 'The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between influenza viruses in different species, including at the animal-human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases of human infections with avian influenza viruses also occurred with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al., 2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal influenza viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of influenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby complicating early detection and efficient control of potential outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent and control zoonotic influenza virus infections. Animal facilities must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness. To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9 influenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype of influenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019). Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2 virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the majority of the population has no protective immunity against the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010).', 'Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).', 'SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013).', 'Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed.', 'The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).', 'The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.', 'JP wrote the manuscript.

V. cholerae is a gram-negative and coma-shaped bacteria. V. cholerae is a facultative anaerobe and has a flagellum at one cell pole as well as pili. The bacteria colonizes the small intestine and produces the cholera toxin which is responsible for a rapid and massive loss of body fluids leading to dehydration, hypovolemic shock and death. V. cholerae strains are classified based on their major lipopolysaccharide O antigens into approximately 206 serogroups of which serogroups O1 (consisting of two biotypes known as classical and El Tor) and O139 cause epidemic cholera (Chatterjee and Chaudhuri, 2006). V. cholerae is a water-borne pathogen. Humans are infected through contaminated water used for drinking or preparing foods. The infection is often mild or asymptomatic and bacteria are eliminated with feces in 1 or 2 weeks. V. cholerae persists indefinitely in aquatic reservoirs and may acquire mobile elements via horizontal gene transfer leading to the emergence of new toxigenic clones (Cho et al., 2010). V. cholerae are able to form a three-dimensional biofilm where the organisms can survive during inter-epidemic periods (Alam et al., 2007). Optimal growth conditions of bacteria in aquatic reservoirs include 15% salinity, 30°C water temperature and pH 8.5 that can be promoted by climate changes (Montilla et al., 1996).', 'Cholera was endemic in Asia until 1817, when a first pandemic spread from India to several other regions of the world (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). This pandemic emerged during a period of increasing globalization resulting from technological progress in transportation. Indeed, the advent of steamships and railways allowed a dramatic decrease in travel time and a rise in trade. At that time, health prevention strategies were essentially the same than those implemented during the Black Death (Tognotti, 2013). Infected persons were isolated in lazarettos. Port entry was forbidden for ships arriving from regions where cholera was present. Travelers who had contacts with infected persons or who came from a place where cholera was circulating were quarantined.', 'Thereafter, five additional major pandemics of cholera that originated from India and spread to other continents occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). The second and sixth pandemics, and presumably the other ones, were caused by the O1 classical biotype of V. cholerae (Devault et al., 2014; Siddique and Cash, 2014). The second pandemic of cholera reached the British islands. During the cholera outbreak in Soho (London), in 1854, the physician John Snow used for the first time epidemiological methods to trace the source of the outbreak. He described the time course of the outbreak and its geographical spread in the city. He identified the public pumps used for water supply in these areas and understood that water was the source of the contamination. He then proposed effective measures to prevent the transmission through the removal of pump handle in the city areas where the outbreak occurred (Smith, 2002). The bacillus of cholera was isolated during the fifth pandemic that extensively affected South America by Robert Koch (1884) who also understood the importance of clean water in preventing its transmission. The toxin responsible for the disease was only discovered in 1959 (De, 1959). The seventh cholera pandemic is the most extensive in terms of geographic spread and duration (Mutreja et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2016). It began in Indonesia in 1961 and became endemic in many regions of the world. It periodically caused major epidemics such as those in Zimbabwe (2008), Haiti (2010), Sierra Leone (2012), Mexico (2013), South Soudan and Ghana (2014) and Yemen (2016). Cholera epidemics usually ended because of a lack of favorable environmental conditions for the survival of vibrios. The seventh cholera pandemic was caused by El Tor biotype strain of V. cholerae that acquired virulence genes in the environment (Safa et al., 2010). In late 1992, the O139 serogroup caused a large cholera outbreak in Bangladesh and neighboring countries and raised the fear of a 8th cholera pandemic (Albert et al., 1993).', 'Cholera cannot be eradicated as it is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems. V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 are responsible for cholera outbreaks in developing countries. In 2019, 923,037 cases and 1,911 deaths were reported to WHO in 31 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020d). However, it is estimated that the global burden of cholera is higher due to underreporting. Between 2008 and 2012, the number of cases was shown to range between 1.3 and 4 millions per year with 95,000 deaths (Ali et al., 2015). Environmental and climate changes may increase the geographical distribution of cholera (Chowdhury et al., 2017). Furthermore, the emergence of environmental non-O1/O139 V. cholerae is increasing as genetic exchange mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer and genetic recombination are favored by changes in ecosystem and climate (Vezzulli et al., 2020). These non-O1/O139 vibrios can cause illness that can be mild (e.g., gastroenteritis, otitis) to life-threatening (necrotizing fasciitis) and could thus constitute a potential threat for humans. The persistence of cholera is related to poor living conditions including shortage of safe drinking water, insufficient sanitation, crowded housing and the lack of efficient sewage systems. Re-emergence of the disease can also occur following natural disasters such as earthquakes that disrupt access to safe water supply. Cholera outbreaks could be predicted based on real-time monitoring of oceanic regions, climate fluctuations and epidemiological surveillance program (Chowdhury et al., 2017). The disease could be prevented by implementation of public health measures to ensure adequate sanitation and safe water supply (Somboonwit et al., 2017). The access to safe drinking water and sanitation are among the primary priorities of the Millenium Development Goals and the sustainable Development Goals (Igere and Ekundayo, 2020). Furthermore, the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program launched by the WHO is central to the prevention of cholera transmission (Wolfe et al., 2018). Currently, three oral cholera vaccines were pre-qualified by the WHO (Dukoral®, SancholTM and Euvochol-Plus®). These vaccines should be used in areas with endemic cholera, cholera outbreaks and humanitarian crisis with high-risk of cholera in combination with other cholera prevention and control measures (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). Cholera is first identified based on clinical symptoms of severe acute watery diarrhea. The disease is then confirmed by the detection of V. cholerae in stool samples by culture, molecular testing or rapid diagnostic tests. The majority of infected individuals can be treated by the administration of prompt oral rehydration solution. Severely dehydrated patients who are at risk of shock require rapid administration of intravenous fluids as well as antibiotics. First-line drug consists of doxycycline whereas alternative treatments include tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin (Hsueh and Waters, 2019).', 'Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001). Their genome consists of 7 or 8 RNA segments encoding at least 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Structural proteins include a hemagglutinin (HA), a neuraminidase (NA), two matrix proteins and a nucleoprotein. Influenza viruses can be distinguished in types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are responsible for outbreaks in tropical regions and seasonal epidemics in temperate regions whereas influenza A viruses are the only ones with a pandemic potential (Lofgren et al., 2007). Indeed, influenza A virus is endemic in a number of species including humans, birds and pigs (Webster et al., 1992). Gene reassortments can thus occur between human and animal influenza A viruses and lead to a new virus subtype which can be pathogenic to humans (Webster et al., 1995).', 'In a typical seasonal epidemics, influenza virus causes 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide (Iuliano et al., 2018). Most typical seasonal influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or classical influenza illness characterized by 4 or 5 days of fever, cough, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness and sometimes upper respiratory tract symptoms (Zambon, 2001). Severe complications can occur especially in infants, elderly and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiac/pulmonary diseases. Among the most severe complications is pneumonia which can be associated with secondary bacterial infection.', 'Annual influenza epidemics are sustained in the human population through mutations occurring especially in the HA and NA viral surface glycoproteins, the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. Seasonal influenza virus results from frequent antigenic drifts every 2–5 years in response to selection pressure to evade human immunity (Kim et al., 2018). Its genome contains segmented genes which may undergo reassortments in cells co-infected with two or more influenza viruses. Each influenza A virus has a gene encoding for 1 of 16 possible HAs and another gene encoding for 1 of 9 possible NAs that are involved in viral attachment and release, respectively (Dugan et al., 2008). Of the 144 total combinatorial possibilities, only 3 HAs and 3 NAs in only 4 combinations (A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and possibly A/H3N8) were found to be truly adapted to humans. Rarely, antigenic shift which results from reassortment between human and animal viruses leads to the emergence of a new virus subtype (Webster et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2009). This antigenically distinct virus may have the ability to infect humans and achieve sustained human-to-human transmission and may cause a pandemic if the immunity in the human population is partial or lacking (Webster et al., 1992).', 'The time in which influenza virus began to infect humans or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but many historians agree that the first influenza pandemic could have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian flu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the first well-described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet (Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide (Table 1). The median Ro was estimated at 2.1 (interquartile range 1.9–2.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010). The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range 45–70%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in individuals aged 1–60 years and lower in infants and seniors (Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age (Valtat et al., 2011).', 'Twenty five years later, the Spanish flu was caused by an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic adaptation of an existing avian influenza virus to a new human host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identification, the virus spread silently around the world and its region of origin could not be determined. Analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from that time confirmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 influenza virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25–33% and the Ro was estimated at 2–3 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918–1919 pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month interval. The first wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918–1919 caused high mortality. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic influenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918–1919 pandemic showed a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young adults aged 20–40 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007) often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that the 1918 influenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis that was observed in 10–15% of cases (Shanks, 2015). The H1 hemagglutinin of the 1918–1919 pandemic virus was identified as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a strong pro-inflammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths occurred from several days to weeks (median 7–10 days) after the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and social distancing. However, these measures were implemented too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I. Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated the spread of the disease.', 'Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus were the cause of almost all seasonal influenza A epidemics worldwide. All influenza A viruses responsible for the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human, avian and swine influenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown in Figure 1.', 'The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957–1959 pandemic (Asian flu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase) by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the 1957–1959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case fatality rate was approximately 0.13% (Mc, 1958). The global mortality of the 1957–1959 influenza pandemic was estimated at 1–2 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases (Viboud et al., 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile range 1.53–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The highest attack rates were in school-age children through young adults up to 35 or 40 years of age (Serfling et al., 1967). Older adults, including those over the age of 60, had significantly lower attack rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults. Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation of the basal layer, limited inflammatory response and evidence of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al., 1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic agent had been identified (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In 1952, the WHO had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided information on the emergence and spread of the novel influenza virus. Containment measures (such as closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for a few weeks only. Influenza vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 53–60%) failed to have a significant impact on the pandemic due to inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009).', 'The 1968–1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989). The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that circulated in the human population since 1957. The global mortality rate of the 1968–1970 pandemic (Hong Kong flu) was estimated to be 0.5–2 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56–1.85) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62–65 years. The first pandemic season was more severe than the second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968–1970 influenza pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age groups and to the HA in the elderly. No specific containment measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977, a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978).', 'The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant made of influenza genes originating from human A/H3N2 (PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1, nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011). The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans, it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the population may be important to prevent future pandemics (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka, 2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed (Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The Ro was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-confirmed deaths. However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between 148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case fatality rate based on confirmed cases was 0.5% (Nishiura, 2010). Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at 0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality rates in younger populations affecting children, young adults and pregnant women were higher than in a typical influenza season. The average age of people who died with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009 pandemic was the first one to combine vaccines and antiviral use. Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine was approved only during the second wave, the immunization program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010). The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the influenza A/H3N2 continued to circulate.', 'Overall, the impacts of an influenza pandemic depend on the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age and past exposure to influenza viruses. The impacts of influenza are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics (Simonsen et al., 1998).', 'The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between influenza viruses in different species, including at the animal-human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases of human infections with avian influenza viruses also occurred with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al., 2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal influenza viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of influenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby complicating early detection and efficient control of potential outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent and control zoonotic influenza virus infections. Animal facilities must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness. To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9 influenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype of influenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019). Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2 virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the majority of the population has no protective immunity against the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010).', 'Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).', 'SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013).', 'Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed.', 'The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).', 'The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.', 'JP wrote the manuscript. GB revised the manuscript. Both authors contributed to the article and approved the submitted version.', 'This study was supported by a Foundation Grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (grant no. 148361 to GB). GB is the holder of the Canada research chair on emerging viruses and antiviral resistance.', 'The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.'], 'The Seven Cholera Pandemics': ['Cholera was endemic in Asia until 1817, when a first pandemic spread from India to several other regions of the world (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). This pandemic emerged during a period of increasing globalization resulting from technological progress in transportation. Indeed, the advent of steamships and railways allowed a dramatic decrease in travel time and a rise in trade. At that time, health prevention strategies were essentially the same than those implemented during the Black Death (Tognotti, 2013). Infected persons were isolated in lazarettos. Port entry was forbidden for ships arriving from regions where cholera was present. Travelers who had contacts with infected persons or who came from a place where cholera was circulating were quarantined.', 'Thereafter, five additional major pandemics of cholera that originated from India and spread to other continents occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries (Table 1) (Faruque et al., 1998). The second and sixth pandemics, and presumably the other ones, were caused by the O1 classical biotype of V. cholerae (Devault et al., 2014; Siddique and Cash, 2014). The second pandemic of cholera reached the British islands. During the cholera outbreak in Soho (London), in 1854, the physician John Snow used for the first time epidemiological methods to trace the source of the outbreak. He described the time course of the outbreak and its geographical spread in the city. He identified the public pumps used for water supply in these areas and understood that water was the source of the contamination. He then proposed effective measures to prevent the transmission through the removal of pump handle in the city areas where the outbreak occurred (Smith, 2002). The bacillus of cholera was isolated during the fifth pandemic that extensively affected South America by Robert Koch (1884) who also understood the importance of clean water in preventing its transmission. The toxin responsible for the disease was only discovered in 1959 (De, 1959). The seventh cholera pandemic is the most extensive in terms of geographic spread and duration (Mutreja et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2016). It began in Indonesia in 1961 and became endemic in many regions of the world. It periodically caused major epidemics such as those in Zimbabwe (2008), Haiti (2010), Sierra Leone (2012), Mexico (2013), South Soudan and Ghana (2014) and Yemen (2016). Cholera epidemics usually ended because of a lack of favorable environmental conditions for the survival of vibrios. The seventh cholera pandemic was caused by El Tor biotype strain of V. cholerae that acquired virulence genes in the environment (Safa et al., 2010). In late 1992, the O139 serogroup caused a large cholera outbreak in Bangladesh and neighboring countries and raised the fear of a 8th cholera pandemic (Albert et al., 1993).', 'Cholera cannot be eradicated as it is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems. V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 are responsible for cholera outbreaks in developing countries. In 2019, 923,037 cases and 1,911 deaths were reported to WHO in 31 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020d). However, it is estimated that the global burden of cholera is higher due to underreporting. Between 2008 and 2012, the number of cases was shown to range between 1.3 and 4 millions per year with 95,000 deaths (Ali et al., 2015). Environmental and climate changes may increase the geographical distribution of cholera (Chowdhury et al., 2017). Furthermore, the emergence of environmental non-O1/O139 V. cholerae is increasing as genetic exchange mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer and genetic recombination are favored by changes in ecosystem and climate (Vezzulli et al., 2020). These non-O1/O139 vibrios can cause illness that can be mild (e.g., gastroenteritis, otitis) to life-threatening (necrotizing fasciitis) and could thus constitute a potential threat for humans. The persistence of cholera is related to poor living conditions including shortage of safe drinking water, insufficient sanitation, crowded housing and the lack of efficient sewage systems. Re-emergence of the disease can also occur following natural disasters such as earthquakes that disrupt access to safe water supply. Cholera outbreaks could be predicted based on real-time monitoring of oceanic regions, climate fluctuations and epidemiological surveillance program (Chowdhury et al., 2017). The disease could be prevented by implementation of public health measures to ensure adequate sanitation and safe water supply (Somboonwit et al., 2017). The access to safe drinking water and sanitation are among the primary priorities of the Millenium Development Goals and the sustainable Development Goals (Igere and Ekundayo, 2020). Furthermore, the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program launched by the WHO is central to the prevention of cholera transmission (Wolfe et al., 2018). Currently, three oral cholera vaccines were pre-qualified by the WHO (Dukoral®, SancholTM and Euvochol-Plus®). These vaccines should be used in areas with endemic cholera, cholera outbreaks and humanitarian crisis with high-risk of cholera in combination with other cholera prevention and control measures (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). Cholera is first identified based on clinical symptoms of severe acute watery diarrhea. The disease is then confirmed by the detection of V. cholerae in stool samples by culture, molecular testing or rapid diagnostic tests. The majority of infected individuals can be treated by the administration of prompt oral rehydration solution. Severely dehydrated patients who are at risk of shock require rapid administration of intravenous fluids as well as antibiotics. First-line drug consists of doxycycline whereas alternative treatments include tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin (Hsueh and Waters, 2019).', 'Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001). Their genome consists of 7 or 8 RNA segments encoding at least 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Structural proteins include a hemagglutinin (HA), a neuraminidase (NA), two matrix proteins and a nucleoprotein. Influenza viruses can be distinguished in types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are responsible for outbreaks in tropical regions and seasonal epidemics in temperate regions whereas influenza A viruses are the only ones with a pandemic potential (Lofgren et al., 2007). Indeed, influenza A virus is endemic in a number of species including humans, birds and pigs (Webster et al., 1992). Gene reassortments can thus occur between human and animal influenza A viruses and lead to a new virus subtype which can be pathogenic to humans (Webster et al., 1995).', 'In a typical seasonal epidemics, influenza virus causes 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide (Iuliano et al., 2018). Most typical seasonal influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or classical influenza illness characterized by 4 or 5 days of fever, cough, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness and sometimes upper respiratory tract symptoms (Zambon, 2001). Severe complications can occur especially in infants, elderly and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiac/pulmonary diseases. Among the most severe complications is pneumonia which can be associated with secondary bacterial infection.', 'Annual influenza epidemics are sustained in the human population through mutations occurring especially in the HA and NA viral surface glycoproteins, the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. Seasonal influenza virus results from frequent antigenic drifts every 2–5 years in response to selection pressure to evade human immunity (Kim et al., 2018). Its genome contains segmented genes which may undergo reassortments in cells co-infected with two or more influenza viruses. Each influenza A virus has a gene encoding for 1 of 16 possible HAs and another gene encoding for 1 of 9 possible NAs that are involved in viral attachment and release, respectively (Dugan et al., 2008). Of the 144 total combinatorial possibilities, only 3 HAs and 3 NAs in only 4 combinations (A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and possibly A/H3N8) were found to be truly adapted to humans. Rarely, antigenic shift which results from reassortment between human and animal viruses leads to the emergence of a new virus subtype (Webster et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2009). This antigenically distinct virus may have the ability to infect humans and achieve sustained human-to-human transmission and may cause a pandemic if the immunity in the human population is partial or lacking (Webster et al., 1992).', 'The time in which influenza virus began to infect humans or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but many historians agree that the first influenza pandemic could have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian flu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the first well-described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet (Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide (Table 1). The median Ro was estimated at 2.1 (interquartile range 1.9–2.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010). The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range 45–70%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in individuals aged 1–60 years and lower in infants and seniors (Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age (Valtat et al., 2011).', 'Twenty five years later, the Spanish flu was caused by an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic adaptation of an existing avian influenza virus to a new human host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identification, the virus spread silently around the world and its region of origin could not be determined. Analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from that time confirmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 influenza virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25–33% and the Ro was estimated at 2–3 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918–1919 pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month interval. The first wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918–1919 caused high mortality. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic influenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918–1919 pandemic showed a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young adults aged 20–40 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007) often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that the 1918 influenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis that was observed in 10–15% of cases (Shanks, 2015). The H1 hemagglutinin of the 1918–1919 pandemic virus was identified as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a strong pro-inflammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths occurred from several days to weeks (median 7–10 days) after the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and social distancing. However, these measures were implemented too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I. Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated the spread of the disease.', 'Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus were the cause of almost all seasonal influenza A epidemics worldwide. All influenza A viruses responsible for the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human, avian and swine influenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown in Figure 1.', 'The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957–1959 pandemic (Asian flu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase) by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the 1957–1959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case fatality rate was approximately 0.13% (Mc, 1958). The global mortality of the 1957–1959 influenza pandemic was estimated at 1–2 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases (Viboud et al., 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile range 1.53–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The highest attack rates were in school-age children through young adults up to 35 or 40 years of age (Serfling et al., 1967). Older adults, including those over the age of 60, had significantly lower attack rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults. Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation of the basal layer, limited inflammatory response and evidence of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al., 1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic agent had been identified (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In 1952, the WHO had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided information on the emergence and spread of the novel influenza virus. Containment measures (such as closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for a few weeks only. Influenza vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 53–60%) failed to have a significant impact on the pandemic due to inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009).', 'The 1968–1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989). The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that circulated in the human population since 1957. The global mortality rate of the 1968–1970 pandemic (Hong Kong flu) was estimated to be 0.5–2 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56–1.85) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62–65 years. The first pandemic season was more severe than the second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968–1970 influenza pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age groups and to the HA in the elderly. No specific containment measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977, a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978).', 'The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant made of influenza genes originating from human A/H3N2 (PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1, nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011). The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans, it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the population may be important to prevent future pandemics (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka, 2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed (Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The Ro was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-confirmed deaths. However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between 148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case fatality rate based on confirmed cases was 0.5% (Nishiura, 2010). Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at 0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality rates in younger populations affecting children, young adults and pregnant women were higher than in a typical influenza season. The average age of people who died with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009 pandemic was the first one to combine vaccines and antiviral use. Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine was approved only during the second wave, the immunization program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010). The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the influenza A/H3N2 continued to circulate.', 'Overall, the impacts of an influenza pandemic depend on the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age and past exposure to influenza viruses. The impacts of influenza are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics (Simonsen et al., 1998).', 'The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between influenza viruses in different species, including at the animal-human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases of human infections with avian influenza viruses also occurred with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al., 2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal influenza viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of influenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby complicating early detection and efficient control of potential outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent and control zoonotic influenza virus infections. Animal facilities must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness. To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9 influenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype of influenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019). Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2 virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the majority of the population has no protective immunity against the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010).', 'Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).', 'SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013).', 'Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed.', 'The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).', 'The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.', 'JP wrote the manuscript.

V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 are responsible for cholera outbreaks in developing countries. In 2019, 923,037 cases and 1,911 deaths were reported to WHO in 31 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020d). However, it is estimated that the global burden of cholera is higher due to underreporting. Between 2008 and 2012, the number of cases was shown to range between 1.3 and 4 millions per year with 95,000 deaths (Ali et al., 2015). Environmental and climate changes may increase the geographical distribution of cholera (Chowdhury et al., 2017). Furthermore, the emergence of environmental non-O1/O139 V. cholerae is increasing as genetic exchange mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer and genetic recombination are favored by changes in ecosystem and climate (Vezzulli et al., 2020). These non-O1/O139 vibrios can cause illness that can be mild (e.g., gastroenteritis, otitis) to life-threatening (necrotizing fasciitis) and could thus constitute a potential threat for humans. The persistence of cholera is related to poor living conditions including shortage of safe drinking water, insufficient sanitation, crowded housing and the lack of efficient sewage systems. Re-emergence of the disease can also occur following natural disasters such as earthquakes that disrupt access to safe water supply. Cholera outbreaks could be predicted based on real-time monitoring of oceanic regions, climate fluctuations and epidemiological surveillance program (Chowdhury et al., 2017). The disease could be prevented by implementation of public health measures to ensure adequate sanitation and safe water supply (Somboonwit et al., 2017). The access to safe drinking water and sanitation are among the primary priorities of the Millenium Development Goals and the sustainable Development Goals (Igere and Ekundayo, 2020). Furthermore, the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program launched by the WHO is central to the prevention of cholera transmission (Wolfe et al., 2018). Currently, three oral cholera vaccines were pre-qualified by the WHO (Dukoral®, SancholTM and Euvochol-Plus®). These vaccines should be used in areas with endemic cholera, cholera outbreaks and humanitarian crisis with high-risk of cholera in combination with other cholera prevention and control measures (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). Cholera is first identified based on clinical symptoms of severe acute watery diarrhea. The disease is then confirmed by the detection of V. cholerae in stool samples by culture, molecular testing or rapid diagnostic tests. The majority of infected individuals can be treated by the administration of prompt oral rehydration solution. Severely dehydrated patients who are at risk of shock require rapid administration of intravenous fluids as well as antibiotics. First-line drug consists of doxycycline whereas alternative treatments include tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin (Hsueh and Waters, 2019).', 'Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001). Their genome consists of 7 or 8 RNA segments encoding at least 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Structural proteins include a hemagglutinin (HA), a neuraminidase (NA), two matrix proteins and a nucleoprotein. Influenza viruses can be distinguished in types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are responsible for outbreaks in tropical regions and seasonal epidemics in temperate regions whereas influenza A viruses are the only ones with a pandemic potential (Lofgren et al., 2007). Indeed, influenza A virus is endemic in a number of species including humans, birds and pigs (Webster et al., 1992). Gene reassortments can thus occur between human and animal influenza A viruses and lead to a new virus subtype which can be pathogenic to humans (Webster et al., 1995).', 'In a typical seasonal epidemics, influenza virus causes 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide (Iuliano et al., 2018). Most typical seasonal influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or classical influenza illness characterized by 4 or 5 days of fever, cough, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness and sometimes upper respiratory tract symptoms (Zambon, 2001). Severe complications can occur especially in infants, elderly and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiac/pulmonary diseases. Among the most severe complications is pneumonia which can be associated with secondary bacterial infection.', 'Annual influenza epidemics are sustained in the human population through mutations occurring especially in the HA and NA viral surface glycoproteins, the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. Seasonal influenza virus results from frequent antigenic drifts every 2–5 years in response to selection pressure to evade human immunity (Kim et al., 2018). Its genome contains segmented genes which may undergo reassortments in cells co-infected with two or more influenza viruses. Each influenza A virus has a gene encoding for 1 of 16 possible HAs and another gene encoding for 1 of 9 possible NAs that are involved in viral attachment and release, respectively (Dugan et al., 2008). Of the 144 total combinatorial possibilities, only 3 HAs and 3 NAs in only 4 combinations (A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and possibly A/H3N8) were found to be truly adapted to humans. Rarely, antigenic shift which results from reassortment between human and animal viruses leads to the emergence of a new virus subtype (Webster et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2009). This antigenically distinct virus may have the ability to infect humans and achieve sustained human-to-human transmission and may cause a pandemic if the immunity in the human population is partial or lacking (Webster et al., 1992).', 'The time in which influenza virus began to infect humans or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but many historians agree that the first influenza pandemic could have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian flu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the first well-described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet (Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide (Table 1). The median Ro was estimated at 2.1 (interquartile range 1.9–2.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010). The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range 45–70%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in individuals aged 1–60 years and lower in infants and seniors (Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age (Valtat et al., 2011).', 'Twenty five years later, the Spanish flu was caused by an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic adaptation of an existing avian influenza virus to a new human host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identification, the virus spread silently around the world and its region of origin could not be determined. Analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from that time confirmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 influenza virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25–33% and the Ro was estimated at 2–3 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918–1919 pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month interval. The first wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918–1919 caused high mortality. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic influenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918–1919 pandemic showed a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young adults aged 20–40 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007) often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that the 1918 influenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis that was observed in 10–15% of cases (Shanks, 2015). The H1 hemagglutinin of the 1918–1919 pandemic virus was identified as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a strong pro-inflammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths occurred from several days to weeks (median 7–10 days) after the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and social distancing. However, these measures were implemented too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I. Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated the spread of the disease.', 'Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus were the cause of almost all seasonal influenza A epidemics worldwide. All influenza A viruses responsible for the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human, avian and swine influenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown in Figure 1.', 'The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957–1959 pandemic (Asian flu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase) by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the 1957–1959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case fatality rate was approximately 0.13% (Mc, 1958). The global mortality of the 1957–1959 influenza pandemic was estimated at 1–2 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases (Viboud et al., 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile range 1.53–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The highest attack rates were in school-age children through young adults up to 35 or 40 years of age (Serfling et al., 1967). Older adults, including those over the age of 60, had significantly lower attack rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults. Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation of the basal layer, limited inflammatory response and evidence of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al., 1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic agent had been identified (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In 1952, the WHO had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided information on the emergence and spread of the novel influenza virus. Containment measures (such as closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for a few weeks only. Influenza vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 53–60%) failed to have a significant impact on the pandemic due to inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009).', 'The 1968–1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989). The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that circulated in the human population since 1957. The global mortality rate of the 1968–1970 pandemic (Hong Kong flu) was estimated to be 0.5–2 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56–1.85) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62–65 years. The first pandemic season was more severe than the second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968–1970 influenza pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age groups and to the HA in the elderly. No specific containment measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977, a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978).', 'The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant made of influenza genes originating from human A/H3N2 (PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1, nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011). The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans, it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the population may be important to prevent future pandemics (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka, 2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed (Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The Ro was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-confirmed deaths. However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between 148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case fatality rate based on confirmed cases was 0.5% (Nishiura, 2010). Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at 0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality rates in younger populations affecting children, young adults and pregnant women were higher than in a typical influenza season. The average age of people who died with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009 pandemic was the first one to combine vaccines and antiviral use. Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine was approved only during the second wave, the immunization program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010). The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the influenza A/H3N2 continued to circulate.', 'Overall, the impacts of an influenza pandemic depend on the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age and past exposure to influenza viruses. The impacts of influenza are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics (Simonsen et al., 1998).', 'The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between influenza viruses in different species, including at the animal-human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases of human infections with avian influenza viruses also occurred with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al., 2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal influenza viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of influenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby complicating early detection and efficient control of potential outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent and control zoonotic influenza virus infections. Animal facilities must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness. To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9 influenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype of influenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019). Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2 virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the majority of the population has no protective immunity against the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010).', 'Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).', 'SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013).', 'Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed.', 'The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).', 'The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.', 'JP wrote the manuscript. GB revised the manuscript.

GB is the holder of the Canada research chair on emerging viruses and antiviral resistance.', 'The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.'], 'Influenza': ['Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001). Their genome consists of 7 or 8 RNA segments encoding at least 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Structural proteins include a hemagglutinin (HA), a neuraminidase (NA), two matrix proteins and a nucleoprotein. Influenza viruses can be distinguished in types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are responsible for outbreaks in tropical regions and seasonal epidemics in temperate regions whereas influenza A viruses are the only ones with a pandemic potential (Lofgren et al., 2007). Indeed, influenza A virus is endemic in a number of species including humans, birds and pigs (Webster et al., 1992). Gene reassortments can thus occur between human and animal influenza A viruses and lead to a new virus subtype which can be pathogenic to humans (Webster et al., 1995).', 'In a typical seasonal epidemics, influenza virus causes 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide (Iuliano et al., 2018). Most typical seasonal influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or classical influenza illness characterized by 4 or 5 days of fever, cough, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness and sometimes upper respiratory tract symptoms (Zambon, 2001). Severe complications can occur especially in infants, elderly and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiac/pulmonary diseases. Among the most severe complications is pneumonia which can be associated with secondary bacterial infection.', 'Annual influenza epidemics are sustained in the human population through mutations occurring especially in the HA and NA viral surface glycoproteins, the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. Seasonal influenza virus results from frequent antigenic drifts every 2–5 years in response to selection pressure to evade human immunity (Kim et al., 2018). Its genome contains segmented genes which may undergo reassortments in cells co-infected with two or more influenza viruses. Each influenza A virus has a gene encoding for 1 of 16 possible HAs and another gene encoding for 1 of 9 possible NAs that are involved in viral attachment and release, respectively (Dugan et al., 2008). Of the 144 total combinatorial possibilities, only 3 HAs and 3 NAs in only 4 combinations (A/H1N1, A/H2N2, A/H3N2 and possibly A/H3N8) were found to be truly adapted to humans. Rarely, antigenic shift which results from reassortment between human and animal viruses leads to the emergence of a new virus subtype (Webster et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2009). This antigenically distinct virus may have the ability to infect humans and achieve sustained human-to-human transmission and may cause a pandemic if the immunity in the human population is partial or lacking (Webster et al., 1992).', 'The time in which influenza virus began to infect humans or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but many historians agree that the first influenza pandemic could have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian flu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the first well-described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet (Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide (Table 1). The median Ro was estimated at 2.1 (interquartile range 1.9–2.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010). The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range 45–70%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in individuals aged 1–60 years and lower in infants and seniors (Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age (Valtat et al., 2011).', 'Twenty five years later, the Spanish flu was caused by an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic adaptation of an existing avian influenza virus to a new human host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identification, the virus spread silently around the world and its region of origin could not be determined. Analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from that time confirmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 influenza virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25–33% and the Ro was estimated at 2–3 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918–1919 pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month interval. The first wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918–1919 caused high mortality. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic influenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918–1919 pandemic showed a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young adults aged 20–40 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007) often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that the 1918 influenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis that was observed in 10–15% of cases (Shanks, 2015). The H1 hemagglutinin of the 1918–1919 pandemic virus was identified as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a strong pro-inflammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths occurred from several days to weeks (median 7–10 days) after the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and social distancing. However, these measures were implemented too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I. Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated the spread of the disease.', 'Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus were the cause of almost all seasonal influenza A epidemics worldwide. All influenza A viruses responsible for the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human, avian and swine influenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown in Figure 1.', 'The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957–1959 pandemic (Asian flu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase) by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the 1957–1959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case fatality rate was approximately 0.13% (Mc, 1958). The global mortality of the 1957–1959 influenza pandemic was estimated at 1–2 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases (Viboud et al., 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile range 1.53–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The highest attack rates were in school-age children through young adults up to 35 or 40 years of age (Serfling et al., 1967). Older adults, including those over the age of 60, had significantly lower attack rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults. Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation of the basal layer, limited inflammatory response and evidence of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al., 1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic agent had been identified (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In 1952, the WHO had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided information on the emergence and spread of the novel influenza virus. Containment measures (such as closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for a few weeks only. Influenza vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 53–60%) failed to have a significant impact on the pandemic due to inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009).', 'The 1968–1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989). The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that circulated in the human population since 1957. The global mortality rate of the 1968–1970 pandemic (Hong Kong flu) was estimated to be 0.5–2 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56–1.85) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62–65 years. The first pandemic season was more severe than the second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968–1970 influenza pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age groups and to the HA in the elderly. No specific containment measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977, a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978).', 'The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant made of influenza genes originating from human A/H3N2 (PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1, nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011). The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans, it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the population may be important to prevent future pandemics (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka, 2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed (Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The Ro was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-confirmed deaths. However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between 148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case fatality rate based on confirmed cases was 0.5% (Nishiura, 2010). Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at 0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality rates in younger populations affecting children, young adults and pregnant women were higher than in a typical influenza season. The average age of people who died with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009 pandemic was the first one to combine vaccines and antiviral use. Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine was approved only during the second wave, the immunization program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010). The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the influenza A/H3N2 continued to circulate.', 'Overall, the impacts of an influenza pandemic depend on the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age and past exposure to influenza viruses. The impacts of influenza are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics (Simonsen et al., 1998).', 'The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between influenza viruses in different species, including at the animal-human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases of human infections with avian influenza viruses also occurred with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al., 2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal influenza viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of influenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby complicating early detection and efficient control of potential outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent and control zoonotic influenza virus infections. Animal facilities must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness. To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9 influenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype of influenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019). Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2 virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the majority of the population has no protective immunity against the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010).', 'Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).', 'SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013).', 'Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed.', 'The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).', 'The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.', 'JP wrote the manuscript.

GB is the holder of the Canada research chair on emerging viruses and antiviral resistance.', 'The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.'], 'Influenza Pandemics': ['The time in which influenza virus began to infect humans or cause a pandemic cannot be determined with accuracy but many historians agree that the first influenza pandemic could have likely occurred in 1510 (Morens et al., 2010). The Russian flu that occurred between 1889 and 1893 was the first well-described pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2007). This pandemic was possibly caused by an A/H3N8 virus based on serologic and epidemiologic data (Worobey et al., 2014). The virus spread rapidly as it took only 4 months to circumvent the planet (Valleron et al., 2010). The pandemic virus reappeared every year for 3 years and caused an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide (Table 1). The median Ro was estimated at 2.1 (interquartile range 1.9–2.4) (Valleron et al., 2010). The case fatality rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.28% so the mortality burden of this pandemic was considered as low (Valleron et al., 2010). The median clinical attack rate was 60% (interquartile range 45–70%) (Valleron et al., 2010). Attack rates were highest in individuals aged 1–60 years and lower in infants and seniors (Valtat et al., 2011). In contrast, mortality rate showed a J-shape curve with highest rates in infants and people over 20 years of age (Valtat et al., 2011).', 'Twenty five years later, the Spanish flu was caused by an A/H1N1 virus (Table 1) that apparently arose by genetic adaptation of an existing avian influenza virus to a new human host (Reid et al., 2004). Before its identification, the virus spread silently around the world and its region of origin could not be determined. Analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples as well as permafrost-frozen corpses from that time confirmed that the strain was an A/H1N1 influenza virus (Reid et al., 1999). Typical attack rates were 25–33% and the Ro was estimated at 2–3 (Mills et al., 2004). The 1918–1919 pandemic spread in at least 3 distinct waves within a 9 month interval. The first wave occurred during spring-summer 1918 and caused high morbidity and low mortality. Both the second and third waves in summer-fall 1918 and winter 1918–1919 caused high mortality. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Fatality of epidemic influenza usually follows a characteristic U-shape curve with high mortality rates in the very young (< 5 years) and the elderly (> 65 years). However, the 1918–1919 pandemic showed a W-shaped mortality curve with high case fatality rates in the very young and the elderly as well as in healthy young adults aged 20–40 years (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). This uncommon age distribution suggests that the severity of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was not primarily due to a hyper-virulent strain but was more likely related to host factors that prevent individuals to control the infection. It is suggested that an A/H3N8 virus was circulating between 1890 and 1900 and that individuals born at this time may have lacked immunity against the antigenically distinct 1918 A/H1N1 virus (Worobey et al., 2014). The most common clinical manifestation was an acute aggressive bronchopneumonia presenting with epithelial necrosis, microvasculitis/vascular necrosis, hemorrhages, edema and severe tissue damage to the lungs (Morens and Fauci, 2007) often followed by secondary bacteria invasion with Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (Morens et al., 2008). It is suggested that the 1918 influenza virus had an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells that could allow bacteria to breach the mucociliary barrier leading to fatal bacterial pneumonia (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The second common clinical manifestation was an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe facial cyanosis that was observed in 10–15% of cases (Shanks, 2015). The H1 hemagglutinin of the 1918–1919 pandemic virus was identified as a key virulence factor for mammalian and was associated with increased respiratory epithelial pathogenicity and elicitation of a strong pro-inflammatory response (Qi et al., 2014). Most deaths occurred from several days to weeks (median 7–10 days) after the onset of symptoms (Shanks and Brundage, 2012). In large cities of Western world, health authorities implemented a series of containment strategies to prevent the spread of the disease including the closure of schools, churches and theaters and the suspension of public gatherings. Physicians encouraged the practice of individual measures such as respiratory hygiene and social distancing. However, these measures were implemented too late and in an uncoordinated manner due to World War I. Travel restrictions and border controls were impossible to put in place. The movement of military troops and the poor living conditions of soldiers in the trench warfare in Europe facilitated the spread of the disease.', 'Over the past century, descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus were the cause of almost all seasonal influenza A epidemics worldwide. All influenza A viruses responsible for the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics (Table 1) also derived from the founding 1918 virus by gene reassortments between human, avian and swine influenza viruses (Morens et al., 2009) as shown in Figure 1.', 'The new subtype A/H2N2 that caused the 1957–1959 pandemic (Asian flu) derived from the 1918 virus by acquisition of 3 new avian gene segments (HA, NA and PB1 polymerase) by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989) whereas the circulating A/H1N1 was totally replaced. Sustained transmission of the 1957–1959 pandemic virus started on December 1957 with recurrent waves occurring over several years (Housworth and Langmuir, 1974). The morbidity was highest in children and the mortality was highest at the extremes of age. The case fatality rate was approximately 0.13% (Mc, 1958). The global mortality of the 1957–1959 influenza pandemic was estimated at 1–2 millions based on excess death due to respiratory diseases (Viboud et al., 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.65 (interquartile range 1.53–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The highest attack rates were in school-age children through young adults up to 35 or 40 years of age (Serfling et al., 1967). Older adults, including those over the age of 60, had significantly lower attack rates. This unusual distribution was attributed to the absence of protective antibody among children and middle-aged adults. Histopathological studies from autopsies were characterized by a rapid development of bronchial epithelial necrosis, preservation of the basal layer, limited inflammatory response and evidence of prompt repair (Walsh et al., 1961). Secondary bacterial pneumonia was a relatively minor cause of fatalities possibly as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics (Robertson et al., 1958; Oseasohn et al., 1959). The proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics was relatively high in fatal cases compared to those isolated from cases who recovered. Furthermore, mechanical ventilators were available in the intensive care units (ICU) to support cases presenting hypoxemia. At that time, the pathogenic agent had been identified (Smith and Andrewes, 1933) and knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease had advanced. In 1952, the WHO had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided information on the emergence and spread of the novel influenza virus. Containment measures (such as closure of schools and nursery, bans on public gatherings) varied from country to country but delayed the onset of the disease for a few weeks only. Influenza vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 53–60%) failed to have a significant impact on the pandemic due to inadequate coverage (Henderson et al., 2009).', 'The 1968–1970 pandemic virus emerged when 2 gene segments encoding for HA and PB1 polymerase moved from an avian virus in the A/H2N2 virus through genetic reassortment whereas the NA remained unchanged (Kawaoka et al., 1989). The new A/H3N2 reassortant replaced the A/H2N2 virus that circulated in the human population since 1957. The global mortality rate of the 1968–1970 pandemic (Hong Kong flu) was estimated to be 0.5–2 millions (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The Ro was estimated at 1.80 (interquartile range 1.56–1.85) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The mean age at death was 62–65 years. The first pandemic season was more severe than the second one in North America whereas the opposite was seen in Europe and Asia (Viboud et al., 2005). The 1968–1970 influenza pandemic was mild in all countries and comparable to severe seasonal epidemics. The mildness of this pandemic is expected considering pre-existing immunity to the NA antigen in all age groups and to the HA in the elderly. No specific containment measures were implemented during this pandemic. In 1977, a descendant of the 1918 A/H1N1 re-emerged suspiciously in Russia and co-circulated with the reassortant A/H3N2 virus thereafter (Gregg et al., 1978).', 'The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was a triple reassortant made of influenza genes originating from human A/H3N2 (PB1 polymerase gene segment), avian (PB2 polymerase and PA polymerase gene segments) and North American (H1, nucleoprotein and Non-structural proteins gene segments) and Eurasian (N1 and matrix proteins gene segments) swine that was transmitted from pigs to humans (Easterbrook et al., 2011). The 2009 H1 protein had minimal antigenic drift compared to its 1918 counterpart. Due to its pathogenicity in humans, it is suggested that the maintenance of H1 immunity in the population may be important to prevent future pandemics (Morens and Taubenberger, 2018). The 2009 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and almost simultaneous outbreaks began in Mexico and in Southern United States (Neumann and Kawaoka, 2011). The virus then spread globally over the next 6 weeks. The A/H1N1pdm09 virus was associated with a lower attack rate in older individuals possibly because of previous exposition to older A/H1N1 viruses. Clinical symptoms associated to the A/H1N1pdm09 range from mild respiratory irritations to severe pneumonia associated to ARDS when infection progressed (Chowell et al., 2009). Asymptomatic infections accounted for approximately 10% of cases (Papenburg et al., 2010). Severe disease developed in a small proportion of healthy adults, many of whom had no underlying conditions (Viboud et al., 2010). The Ro was estimated at 1.46 (interquartile 1.30–1.70) (Biggerstaff et al., 2014). The WHO reported 18,631 laboratory-confirmed deaths. However, the mortality burden was estimated to be between 148,000 and 249,000 based on excess death due to respiratory diseases in several countries (Simonsen et al., 2013). The case fatality rate based on confirmed cases was 0.5% (Nishiura, 2010). Later studies estimated the symptomatic case fatality rate at 0.05% of all medically attended symptomatic cases. Mortality rates in younger populations affecting children, young adults and pregnant women were higher than in a typical influenza season. The average age of people who died with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 37 years (Vaillant et al., 2009). Non-pharmaceutical interventions that were implemented included hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette (Cantey et al., 2013). The 2009 pandemic was the first one to combine vaccines and antiviral use. Symptomatic individuals and their contacts were isolated and received antiviral treatment as prophylaxis. Although the vaccine was approved only during the second wave, the immunization program in Canada covered 33 to 50% of its population compared to 13 to 39% in United States (Gilmour and Hofmann, 2010). The new pandemic virus completely replaced the prior circulating seasonal A/H1N1 whereas the influenza A/H3N2 continued to circulate.', 'Overall, the impacts of an influenza pandemic depend on the transmissibility and virulence of the strain and on the susceptibility of the population, which may vary according to age and past exposure to influenza viruses. The impacts of influenza are not always higher during pandemics than during seasonal epidemic periods. However, a shift in the age distribution of mortality toward younger age groups distinguishes the impacts of a pandemic from those of seasonal epidemics (Simonsen et al., 1998).', 'The constant adaptation and exchange of genes between influenza viruses in different species, including at the animal-human interface, is still a critical challenge for the emergence of pandemic viruses nowadays. In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b). To date, sporadic familial clusters of A/H7N9 have been reported but there is still no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus (Wu et al., 2020). Sporadic cases of human infections with avian influenza viruses also occurred with A/H5N6, A/H6N1, A/H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N4, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H10N8 strains (Widdowson et al., 2017). Surveillance programs for monitoring animal influenza viruses with zoonotic potential facilitate the rapid detection of human threats. However, obvious clinical manifestations of influenza infections may be lacking in avian species thereby complicating early detection and efficient control of potential outbreaks (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, the conditions required for cross-species transmission from avian species to humans are not yet elucidated and surveillance programs would most likely require longitudinal surveillance in multiple hosts. Non-pharmaceutical measures aim to reduce the number of live-bird markets and to decrease contacts between humans and birds in breeding facilities have been implemented to prevent and control zoonotic influenza virus infections. Animal facilities must be periodically disinfected and employees exposed to birds must wear protective personal equipment and be isolated in case of suspected contamination. Pharmaceutical measures include the use of vaccines (including poultry vaccination) and antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) (Beigel and Hayden, 2020). The WHO together with reference laboratories determine viral antigenicity of strains circulating in avian species that could be used in the development of candidate vaccines for pandemic preparedness. To date, candidate vaccines are available for H5, H7 and H9 influenza viruses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a). The development of a universal vaccine to prevent any subtype of influenza virus is a priority (Yamayoshi and Kawaoka, 2019). Finally, it is not excluded that the circulating human A/H3N2 virus could acquire an avian H2 gene by reassortment. As the majority of the population has no protective immunity against the H2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968, the emergence of a H2N2 reassortant could be a potential risk for a future pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2010).', 'Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and include four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).', 'SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013).', 'Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed.', 'The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).', 'The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.', 'JP wrote the manuscript.

In this respect, a series of avian influenza A viruses have caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe diseases and deaths in humans (Li et al., 2019). These viruses are divided into two groups, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, based on their virulence in chicken. The first human outbreak due to a HPAI was caused by an A/H5N1 virus in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 positive cases associated with 6 deaths were reported (Chan, 2002). This A/H5N1 HPAI virus continues to spread in poultry and in a large number of wild bird species on several continents. This virus caused severe and fatal spillover infections in humans and rarely resulted in human-to-human transmission (Ungchusak et al., 2005). This virus was eventually detected in 17 countries and led to 861 human cases with a case fatality rate of 53% as of October 23, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b). The A/H5N1 virus has thus a potential for high morbidity and mortality in humans but it seems unlikely that it could become adapted with efficient human-to-human transmission (Morens and Taubenberger, 2015). A LPAI A/H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 (Gao et al., 2013). This virus was then shown to evolve to highly pathogenic strains in late 2016 (Kile et al., 2017). Infection with A/H7N9 has been reported in 1,567 human cases with a fatality rate of 39% as of September 5, 2018 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018b).

SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020). These methods can target either the immature stages (by the use of predator species and chemical or biological larvicides or by the modification of the habitat) or the adult vectors (by the use of nets, topical repellents, insecticides and spraying). Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016).

The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020).

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals and humans. The genome encodes non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins including the membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause seasonal respiratory diseases, and to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. HCoV-229E (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronavirus) are the causative agents of common cold (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). HCoV-NL63 (alpha-coronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (beta-coronavirus) cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Kahn and McIntosh, 2005). Furthermore, beta-coronaviruses also include three highly pathogenic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that induce severe pneumonia in humans (Table 1) (Song et al., 2019).', 'SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong province (China) in 2003. Bats are likely the possible natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and palm civets could be intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans (Guan et al., 2003). The causative agent was identified within a few weeks (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). During the 2002–2003 outbreak, SARS-CoV infection was reported in 29 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Overall, 8,437 probable cases were reported with 813 SARS-related fatalities (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). The case fatality rate was 9.7%. Transmission of SARS-CoV was mainly nosocomial with rates of 33–42% whereas rates of 22–39% occurred between family members (Chowell et al., 2015). Infection with SARS-CoV typically caused an influenza-like syndrome with rigors, fatigue and high fever. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In 20–30% of infected patients, the disease progressed to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli with the patients requiring management in ICU or mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients also developed watery diarrhea with active virus shedding. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death among patients infected with SARS-CoV. The major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV were droplets, aerosols and fomites (Seto et al., 2003). The Ro of SARS-CoV was approximately 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate. Protective immunity against this virus as well as effective antiviral drugs and vaccines were lacking. The low infectivity and long incubation period (viral load peaks at 6–11 days after symptom onset) of SARS-CoV provided time for implementing a series of containment measures to prevent transmission (Weinstein, 2004). Case identification and isolation followed by contact tracing and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat and eradicating the virus in almost 7 months. However, some SARS-CoV-like viruses found in bats have been shown to be able to infect human cells without prior adaptation, which indicates that SARS could re-emerge in the future (Ge et al., 2013).', 'Ten years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was reported in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020). Critically ill patients required to be managed in an ICU. The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020).

The WHO is supporting molecular and serological surveillance studies at the dromedary-human interface in several Middle East countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2018c). Indeed, recombination events were reported to occur leading to different lineages of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). New MERS-CoV variants were also shown to emerge over time (AlBalwi et al., 2020). Furthermore, this organization has issued recommendations for not consuming unpasteurized camel milk and undercooked animal products and to be cautious in cases of close contacts with dromedary camels. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices and implementation of contact and droplet precautions are crucial to limit future nosocomial outbreaks. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS-CoV cases and isolation of individuals to break the chain of infections in the community is also essential. The WHO calls for the development of three types of vaccines against MERS-CoV: a human vaccine that is intended for long-term protection of individuals at high-risk of exposure such as health care workers and those having contacts with potentially infected dromedary camels, a human vaccine for use during outbreaks and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic transmission (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017b). The spike protein of MERS-CoV is an important target for the development of vaccines (Zhang N. et al., 2020). These vaccines are based on DNA, viral vectors, viral proteins, virus-like particles, bacterium-like particles and nanoparticles. The progression of most of these vaccines from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials are prevented by lack of funds. Only a few ones were tested in phase I clinical studies until now.', 'In early December 2019, atypical pneumonia were reported in a cluster of patients in Wuhan (China) and were shown to be caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020) whereas the disease is referred to as COVID-19. The animal reservoirs are likely bats (Lau et al., 2020). It was proposed that pangolins could be the animal hosts that transmit the virus to humans (Lam et al., 2020) but the intermediary host, if any, has not yet been definitely identified. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic (up to 40% of cases) or causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild symptoms to life-threatening disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Infected individuals most commonly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Common complications among hospitalized patients include pneumonia, ARDS, acute liver injury, cardiac injury, prothrombotic coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and neurologic manifestations. Critically ill patients could also develop a cytokine storm and a macrophage activation syndrome. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease have been present in 60–90% of hospitalized patients (Richardson et al., 2020). Mild symptoms occurred in 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases. Approximately 14–19% of patients are hospitalized and 3–5% of cases require transfer to ICU, most commonly due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Among them, 29–91% necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 15–20% whereas it is as high as 40% in patients requiring ICU admission. The global estimated case fatality rate ranges between 0.25 and 3.0% (Wilson N. et al., 2020). Mortality ranges from 0.02% in patients aged 20–49 years to 0.5% for patients aged 50–69 years and greater than 5.4% for patients aged more than 80 years. Children with COVID-19 have milder symptoms predominantly limited to the upper respiratory tract. However, a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described in some children with COVID-19 (Rowley et al., 2020). Impaired type I interferon response was shown to be involved in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020). The Ro is estimated to be between 2 and 3 (Petersen et al., 2020). COVID-19 has spread globally within a few months leading to more than 74 million contaminations and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of December 18, 2020 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020e).', 'Multiple public health measures have been implemented by most countries such as individual actions (physical distancing, hand washing, use of face masks and cough etiquette), identification of clusters (case identification, contact tracing and isolation), regulatory actions (school closure, workplace closure, stay-at-home order, public transport closure and restriction, limits on size of gatherings and business capacity), closures of internal and international borders, travel restrictions and enforced quarantine. The goal of these public health measures being to delay and flatten the epidemic curve, preventing overwhelming capacity of the health care system and protecting individuals at highest risk of severe outcome before safe and effective vaccines and treatments are available. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV, viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 starts a few days before symptom onset (pre-symptomatic) and some patients remain asymptomatic while they shed the virus which make case isolation measures less efficient (Ganyani et al., 2020). In less than a year (as of December 11, 2020), a first vaccine based on a new platform consisting of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the virus (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech) has been granted for Emergency Use designation by the US FDA. Several other vaccines based on inactivated whole virus, recombinant non-replicative viral vector, recombinant spike protein and virus-like particles are in late phases of clinical investigation (Batty et al., 2020). The antiviral remdesivir (a repurposed drug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus) received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 by the WHO (Lamontagne et al., 2020).', 'Plague and cholera pandemics first disseminated along trade and military routes. Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices.

Furthermore, novel vector control methods are under development such as the genetic manipulation of mosquitos (Hammond and Galizi, 2017), bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia) (Flores and O’Neill, 2018) and eave tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting (Knols et al., 2016). However, the development of novel vector control tools is still needed.', 'The implementation of global surveillance programs for the rapid detection of pathogen spillover from animal to the human population is of prime importance. The One Health concept promotes optimal health for human, animal and environment (One Health Commission [OHC], 2020). The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries. These multidisciplinary efforts could have positive impacts in these countries as they are the most afflicted by the effects of zoonoses (Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014).', 'Viral zoonoses constitute particularly a serious threat to public health as viruses were at the origin of the most recent pandemics. It is thus important to evaluate the risk of cross-species transmission of viruses to humans. The viral richness associated to an animal species could predict zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses (Olival et al., 2017). It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020). Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis of nasal/throat swabs from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections was also used to expand the detection of novel viruses and the characterization of the respiratory virome of humans exposed to animals (Thi Kha Tu et al., 2020).', 'The time of onset and the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, pandemic preparedness plans emphasize that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be implemented first to control human-to-human transmission of the pathogen. Ideally, these interventions should adequately control the spread of an infection while minimizing societal and economic disruption. Risks of resurgence can follow once these non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Once available, rapid testing together with contact tracing (Teixeira and Doetsch, 2020) and isolation of infected individuals should be put in place for a more effective response. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions including rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (Hussein et al., 2020), biomarkers for disease stratification (Maertzdorf et al., 2016), broad spectrum antimicrobials/antivirals obtained through in silico drug repurposing (Mangione et al., 2020) or by the use of drugs targeting host cells (Lee and Yen, 2012) as well as new platforms for accelerated vaccine development and production (Rauch et al., 2018) should be developed to improve the global response to the pandemic.', 'JP wrote the manuscript.

The potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV are bats and dromedary camels have been suggested as the intermediary hosts (Conzade et al., 2018). Advances in molecular diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing allowed that the etiological agent was identified within weeks of global spread (Zaki et al., 2012). Between 2012 and 2020, 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with at least 866 deaths were reported in 27 countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020c). All cases have been linked to persons in the Arabian Peninsula or who had returned from traveling in MERS-CoV endemic areas. Almost 50% of MERS-CoV cases were due to nosocomial transmission to inpatients, health care workers and visitors (Hui et al., 2018). Transmission between family members has only occurred in 13–21% of cases (Chowell et al., 2015). Individuals with MERS-CoV present with a wide range of clinical features from mild to severe fulminant pulmonary disease (Memish et al., 2020). Those with severe disease are often older than 65 years with comorbidities and can develop symptoms at a later time. Asymptomatic to mild infection rates of 25–50% have been reported. Infection with MERS-CoV causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction with various clinical symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia and myalgia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is estimated that 50–89% of patients with progression to respiratory and/or renal failure require ICU admission. The high incidence of ARDS in these patients is reflected by a high case fatality rate of 34%. The Ro of MERS-CoV is low (approximately 1) (Petersen et al., 2020) which allows to control the transmission in the absence of mitigation strategies, although the virus caused several nosocomial outbreaks in hospital of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea.', 'MERS-CoV is still circulating nowadays. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans (Kandeil et al., 2019) and the continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks (Sikkema et al., 2019). Furthermore, the outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread around the world and thus to be a threat for global health (Petersen et al., 2015). There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available against MERS-CoV infection. The clinical management of patients with MERS-CoV consists mainly in providing supportive care for the relief of pain and fever, supporting vital organ functions and treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics (Memish et al., 2020).

The environmental effects resulting from land use, urbanization and climate changes may increase the risk of pathogens spillover from animals to humans and emphasize the importance of a One Health integrative approach for the surveillance of zoonosis (Okello et al., 2011; Rabozzi et al., 2012). Such integrative approaches are used to implement surveillance programs for the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging infections in developing countries.

It was shown that the cross-species transmission of mammalian viruses increases with respect to the phylogenetic proximity between hosts and humans. Furthermore, viruses that infect a phylogenetically broader ranges of hosts are more likely to be zoonotic. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response during an outbreak (Epstein and Anthony, 2017). Furthermore, the global virome project was launched to detect and identify viral threats to human health, characterize the host ranges of viruses, identify behaviors that favor spillover, establish a global surveillance network and identify transmission and pathogenicity markers for high-risk viruses (Carroll et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2020).

Thereafter, the geographical spread of pathogens followed the movement of human population through rail, ship and air travels. Nowadays, the globalization of travels and trade of animals and animal-based foods further increase the spread of infectious diseases and the speed with which they are disseminated around the world. Land use and urbanization to accommodate agriculture and living areas modify the habitats of pathogens, hosts and disease vectors and affect the transmission dynamics of infections to humans. The geographic distribution of disease vectors and hosts as well as the living habitats of microorganisms is also affected by climate changes and could potentially increase the spread of pathogens. Increased contacts between humans and animals through breeding, hunting, wet markets and trade of exotic pets also favor the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens. The spread of infectious diseases is thus expected to increase due to human activities and their effects on the environment. Epidemics and pandemics will also occur more frequently and will represent new challenges for public health.', 'In order to control the transmission of water-borne pathogens such as V. cholera, the WHO has launched a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program in developing countries (Matilla et al., 2018). This program emphasizes the provision of safe and clean sources of water, effective sanitation infrastructure and ensures appropriate hygiene practices. The WASH program was reported to increase safe drinking water accesses, safe sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home to 71%, 45% and 60% of the global population, respectively (UNICEF and World Health Organization [WHO], 2019).', 'Vector control is the primary tool to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus (Wilson A.L. et al., 2020).

Prior to the launch, skepticism had been widespread about the U.S.S.R.’s technical capabilities to develop both a sophisticated scientific satellite and a rocket powerful enough to put it into orbit. Under Korolyov’s direction, however, the Soviet Union had been building an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), with engines designed by Glushko, that was capable of delivering a heavy nuclear warhead to American targets. That ICBM, called the R-7 or Semyorka (“Number 7”), was first successfully tested on August 21, 1957, which cleared the way for its use to launch a satellite. Fearing that development of the elaborate scientific satellite intended as the Soviet IGY contribution would keep the U.S.S.R. from being the first into space, Korolyov and his associates, particularly Tikhonravov, designed a much simpler 83.6-kg (184.3-pound) sphere carrying only two radio transmitters and four antennas. After the success of the R-7 in August, that satellite was rushed into production and became Sputnik 1. A second, larger satellite carrying scientific instruments and the dog Laika, the first living creature in orbit, was launched November 3. The even larger, instrumented spacecraft originally intended to be the first Soviet satellite went into orbit in May 1958 as Sputnik 3. (For additional information on Korolyov’s contribution to the Soviet space program, see Energia.)', 'After President Eisenhower, in May 1955, had committed the United States to an IGY satellite, the army, navy, and air force competed for the assignment. (No civilian organization existed that was capable of developing the launch vehicle needed.) The mission was assigned to the Naval Research Laboratory rather than to the army’s Redstone Arsenal, where Braun worked, so that the work would not interfere with Redstone’s higher-priority development of ballistic missiles. The navy project, called Vanguard, would use a new launch vehicle based on modified Viking and Aerobee sounding rockets to orbit a small scientific satellite. Vanguard made slow progress over the subsequent two years, but, after Sputnik’s success, the White House pressed to have the satellite launched as quickly as possible. On December 6, 1957, the Vanguard rocket rose only slightly off its launch pad before exploding and sending the satellite not into orbit but onto a Florida beach.', 'Braun and his army superiors had not agreed with the decision to assign the satellite mission to the navy. After the launches of the first two Sputniks, they secured permission to attempt their own satellite launch. In anticipation of such a situation, they had kept in touch with JPL and Van Allen and so were able to prepare a satellite quickly. On January 31, 1958, Braun’s Jupiter-C launch vehicle, a modified Redstone ballistic missile, carried into orbit Explorer 1, the first U.S. satellite. Designed at JPL, Explorer 1 carried Van Allen’s experiment to measure cosmic rays. The results from this experiment and similar ones aboard other U.S. and Soviet satellites launched that same year revealed that Earth is surrounded by two zones of radiation, now known as the Van Allen radiation belts, comprising energetic particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field.', 'Initial satellite launches were scientific in character, but U.S. government interest in reconnaissance satellites persisted. In February 1958, President Eisenhower authorized the development, under conditions of great secrecy, of such a spacecraft. The project, which came to be called Corona, would take pictures over the Soviet Union and return them to Earth by dropping the exposed film in a capsule that would be snatched out of the air as it parachuted back from space. After 12 failures, the first successful Corona mission took place on August 18, 1960; the returned film contained images of many previously unknown Soviet airfields and missile sites.'], 'Development of space organizations': []}}

': ['\n"Third World" is an outdated and derogatory phrase that has been used historically to describe a class of economically developing nations. It is part of a four-part segmentation that was used to describe the world’s economies by economic status. Third World falls behind First World and Second World but was ahead of Fourth World, though Fourth-World countries were hardly recognized at all. Today, the preferred terminology is a developing nation, an underdeveloped country, or a low- and middle-income country (LMIC).\n', '\nThere can be a few ways to divide up the world for purposes of economic segmentation. Classifying countries as First, Second, Third, and Fourth World was a concept created during and after the Cold War, which ran from approximately 1945 to the 1990s.\n', '\nIn general, nations are typically characterized by economic status and key economic metrics like gross domestic product (GDP), GDP growth, GDP per capita, employment growth, and an unemployment rate. In developing countries, low production rates and struggling labor market characteristics are usually paired with relatively low levels of education, poor infrastructure, improper sanitation, limited access to health care, and lower costs of living.\n', '\nDeveloping nations are closely watched by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which seek to provide global aid for the purposes of projects that help to improve infrastructure and economic systems comprehensively. Both organizations refer to these countries as lower-middle or low-income countries.\n', '\nDeveloping nations, or LMIC, can be the target of many investors seeking to identify potentially high returns through possible growth opportunities, though risks are also relatively higher. While developing countries are generally characterized as performing poorer economically, innovative and industrial breakthroughs can lead to substantial improvements in a short amount of time.\n', '\nThe classification of nations as First World or Third World emerged during and after the Cold War. First-World countries were known as the most highly industrialized nations whose views aligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and\xa0capitalism.\n', '\nSecond-World countries supported\xa0communism\xa0and the Soviet Union. Most of these countries were formerly controlled by the Soviet Union. Many countries of East Asia also fit into the Second-World category.\n', '\nThird-World countries\xa0included nations in Asia and Africa that were not aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Now, in part because the Soviet Union no longer exists, the definition of Third World is outdated and may be considered offensive to many.\n', '\nAlfred Sauvy, a French demographer, anthropologist, and historian, is credited with coining the term Third World during the Cold War. Sauvy\xa0observed a group of countries, many former colonies, that did not share the ideological views of Western capitalism or Soviet socialism. "Three worlds, one planet," wrote Sauvy in a 1952 article published in\xa0L\'Observateur.\ufeff\ufeff\n', '\nIn the modern-day, most countries on Earth fall into one of three general categories that some refer to as developed, emerging, and frontier. The world segmentations have somewhat migrated to fit within these categories overall.\n', '\nThe developed countries are the most industrialized with the strongest economic characteristics. The emerging countries are classified as such because they demonstrate significant strides in various economic growth areas though their metrics are not as stable. The frontier markets often closely mirror the old Third-World classification and often show the lowest economical indicators.\n', '\nThe evolutions of the worldly segmentations have become historic and obsolete. As such, one barometer for assessing a list of developing countries is MSCI’s Frontier Markets Index. This index includes the following countries:\n', '\nThe World Trade Organization\xa0(WTO), also provides another point of reference. The WTO divides countries into two classes: developing and least developed. There are no criteria for these classifications so countries self-nominate, though statuses can be contested by other nations.\n', '\nThe WTO segregation comes with certain rights for developing country status. For example, the WTO grants developing countries longer transition periods before implementing agreements that aim to increase trading opportunities and infrastructure support related to WTO work.\n', '\nAs an offshoot of the WTO, the Human Development Index\xa0(HDI) is another economic status metric developed by the United Nations to assess the social and economic development levels of countries. The HDI measures and then ranks a country based on schooling, life expectancy, and gross national income per capita.\n', '\nThe World Health Organization and the United Nations uses Least Developed Countries (LDC) to describe a set of 48 countries with low socioeconomic developmental indicators.

Classifying countries as First, Second, Third, and Fourth World was a concept created during and after the Cold War, which ran from approximately 1945 to the 1990s.\n', '\nIn general, nations are typically characterized by economic status and key economic metrics like gross domestic product (GDP), GDP growth, GDP per capita, employment growth, and an unemployment rate. In developing countries, low production rates and struggling labor market characteristics are usually paired with relatively low levels of education, poor infrastructure, improper sanitation, limited access to health care, and lower costs of living.\n', '\nDeveloping nations are closely watched by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which seek to provide global aid for the purposes of projects that help to improve infrastructure and economic systems comprehensively. Both organizations refer to these countries as lower-middle or low-income countries.\n', '\nDeveloping nations, or LMIC, can be the target of many investors seeking to identify potentially high returns through possible growth opportunities, though risks are also relatively higher. While developing countries are generally characterized as performing poorer economically, innovative and industrial breakthroughs can lead to substantial improvements in a short amount of time.\n', '\nThe classification of nations as First World or Third World emerged during and after the Cold War. First-World countries were known as the most highly industrialized nations whose views aligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and\xa0capitalism.\n', '\nSecond-World countries supported\xa0communism\xa0and the Soviet Union. Most of these countries were formerly controlled by the Soviet Union. Many countries of East Asia also fit into the Second-World category.\n', '\nThird-World countries\xa0included nations in Asia and Africa that were not aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Now, in part because the Soviet Union no longer exists, the definition of Third World is outdated and may be considered offensive to many.\n', '\nAlfred Sauvy, a French demographer, anthropologist, and historian, is credited with coining the term Third World during the Cold War. Sauvy\xa0observed a group of countries, many former colonies, that did not share the ideological views of Western capitalism or Soviet socialism. "Three worlds, one planet," wrote Sauvy in a 1952 article published in\xa0L\'Observateur.\ufeff\ufeff\n', '\nIn the modern-day, most countries on Earth fall into one of three general categories that some refer to as developed, emerging, and frontier. The world segmentations have somewhat migrated to fit within these categories overall.\n', '\nThe developed countries are the most industrialized with the strongest economic characteristics. The emerging countries are classified as such because they demonstrate significant strides in various economic growth areas though their metrics are not as stable. The frontier markets often closely mirror the old Third-World classification and often show the lowest economical indicators.\n', '\nThe evolutions of the worldly segmentations have become historic and obsolete. As such, one barometer for assessing a list of developing countries is MSCI’s Frontier Markets Index. This index includes the following countries:\n', '\nThe World Trade Organization\xa0(WTO), also provides another point of reference. The WTO divides countries into two classes: developing and least developed. There are no criteria for these classifications so countries self-nominate, though statuses can be contested by other nations.\n', '\nThe WTO segregation comes with certain rights for developing country status. For example, the WTO grants developing countries longer transition periods before implementing agreements that aim to increase trading opportunities and infrastructure support related to WTO work.\n', '\nAs an offshoot of the WTO, the Human Development Index\xa0(HDI) is another economic status metric developed by the United Nations to assess the social and economic development levels of countries.

If you are a digital native, this task is simply impossible.', 'Millennials - also known as digital customers - will never experience a world with no connectivity and mobile devices. Yes, there are still (small) areas of our planet not wired and cabled but - at least for us living in developed countries - it is hard to imagine a life before Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook.', 'If you search on Google (where else!), you will find tons of experiments or researches about life without the Internet.

But in today’s world, it is popularly known as a process which sets in motion the socio-political development of a country by bonding loosely associated societies into a common community of one identity under the concept of Nation. Therefore, the basic purpose and objective of nation-building is to bring unity among the people of a country so that the political viability of a country can sustain for a long period of time. But according to economists, the concept of nation-building has always been the process of creating a properly functioning country out of the one that is not, which basically means to transform a collapsed country that was either destroyed in a war or never functioned as a country in the first place into a country having a legitimately functioning government and effective social institutions with credible currency and a well-functioning economy.', 'Citizens of a country who are considered as the legal members of a nation act as one of the dominant pillars in the process of building a nation. Dynamic co-operation from every individual citizen acts as a major contribution towards this multidimensional concept of nation-building. This concept of citizenship which has obtained a whole new meaning in this current democratic world majorly emphasizes on the duties and responsibilities of citizens towards one’s own country. Each citizen has to fulfil various duties like paying his taxes, exercise his right of vote, discourage corruption by discouraging bribing, educate people and follow the rules and regulations as a responsible citizen of this country. Therefore a solid and powerful nation can be built from the dedication and hard work of its citizens and some smart measures and implementations of the Government. ', 'There are two basic principles that are followed in today’s world to determine a person’s citizenship, one is inus soli: the principle which considers and classifies people residing and living within the territory of a country as citizens, irrespective of their religion, linguistic roots and ethnicity. Hence living within the boundaries and on the territory of a country has been one of the basic criteria to consider a person as a citizen and bind him with all the legal rights and obligations that are connected to the concept of citizenship. The other one is inus sanguis which entitles the descendants and descending generations of the people who strived to build the country and lived in that territory for ages with citizenship. ', 'Though there are many ways to build a nation, the contribution of a citizen towards this process of building a nation is unparalleled. Citizens are the greatest source of power for a country. Without citizens, a state or a country is just a piece of land. Every citizen’s dedication will definitely pave the way towards a better nation. We are the soul of a nation and when we strive and perform our duties towards the best interest of our country, only then our country will take a step towards development. Therefore I summarize my words through this quote of Mahatma Gandhi- ‘The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.‘'], 'Duty of Citizens in Nation Building': ['Though there are many ways to build a nation, the contribution of a citizen towards this process of building a nation is unparalleled.

   'Management and Treatment': ['How are mental health disorders treated?Treatments for mental health disorders may include:Medication: Some mental illnesses respond well to medication, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics. These medicines change the chemicals in your brain, so you experience fewer symptoms. It’s very important to take medication exactly as your healthcare provider directs. Never stop taking medication for a mental illness without consulting your healthcare provider.Psychotherapy: Talking to a mental health professional can help you work through the challenges of an illness and manage its symptoms. Psychotherapy can be in a one-to-one setting with a healthcare provider or a group setting. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy. It focuses on helping you change negative behaviors and thought patterns.Alternative therapies: Some mental illnesses, such as depression, may improve with alternative therapies. Examples include herbal remedies, massage, acupuncture, yoga and meditation. Talk to your healthcare provider before taking any herbal remedies or supplements. They may affect other medications.Brain stimulation therapies: Not all disorders improve with medication. If that’s the case, your healthcare provider may recommend brain stimulation therapies. These treatments change the way nerves and other cells in your brain process chemicals and respond to stimuli. Examples include electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).'],

   'The meaning of pollution control ': ['Pollution control is the limitation or eradication of the release of harmful substances into the environment.'],
   'Effects of pollutants': ['Polluting substances can damage the environment, ecosystems, and human health. Here are some key examples of how pollution affects our planet:'],
   'Principles of pollution control': ['These are the three principles of pollutant control that are used to varying degrees around the world:'],
   'The importance of pollutant control': ["Let's take a look at some of the reasons pollutant control is important:"],
   'Methods of pollution control': ["So now we know what pollution control is and the principles behind it, let's have a look at the methods individuals and companies use to control specific pollutants:"],
   'Smoke (PM10)': ['Often shrouded in black smog, smoke can contain carbon (C), tar, and ash and causes respiratory problems and even cancer in animals and humans.'],
   'Acid precipitation': ['Acid rain is precipitation exhibiting a pH of 5.2 or less. Nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide emissions will react with water vapour in clouds to form nitric acid (HNO3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4), which then fall as acid rain. Nitrous oxide will also initiate the formation of ground-level ozone (O3), which is a greenhouse gas.'],
   'Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons': ['Carbon monoxide is a dangerous gas released from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and can cause fatal respiratory problems by binding to haemoglobin molecules. Hydrocarbons are released in the same way and can sometimes form volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air, which contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone. Oxidative catalysts in catalytic converters will oxidise carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water.'],
   'Oil pollution': ['Oil spills from tanker accidents, pipeline leaks, and waste lubricating oil can pollute oceans and lakes. This can be very dangerous for marine organisms because they can become trapped and suffer hypothermia. The migration and reproduction of wildlife are affected, as well as sunlight availability for aquatic producers.'],
   'Pesticides': ["Polluting pesticides are synthetic mixtures sprayed directly on crops or over a general area to deter or exterminate 'pests' (e.g. locusts, aphids, caterpillars). These substances often contain toxic chemicals that can negatively affect non-target organisms and bioaccumulate in the ecosystem.Pesticide pollution is reduced by introducing regulations on the quantities and types (most poisonous) of pesticides that farmers can use. Shifting to sustainable agricultural methods is essential in improving the gene pool in the agroecosystem and slowing the spread of disease.NutrientsThe overuse of fertilisers in agriculture can result in soils becoming overloaded with nitrates and phosphates, which can leach into nearby waters. Sewage treatment plants focus on removing toxic substances, so masses of nutrients may be flushed into water sources. Urban waste contains lots of nutrients as well and is often improperly disposed of.Especially in underdeveloped countries with poor infrastructure Polluted waters can undergo eutrophication, which involves the formation of 'algal blooms' from an excess of nutrients. When these algal blooms are decomposed, the ecosystem will be starved of oxygen, and life cannot survive.Here are some ways to reduce nutrient pollution: Regenerative agriculture: innovative farming methods such as intercropping, under-sowing, and cover cropping will improve soil fertility and reduce the need for fertilisers.Primary sedimentation: removes settleable organic solids from the slurry. Secondary sedimentation: separates the waste into organic sludge and effluent after aerobic decomposition by microorganisms.Tertiary sedimentation: involves anaerobic sludge digestion and phosphate materials.Heavy metals Lead (Pb) can pollute waters through the corrosion of old lead pipes and the improper disposal of waste containing cosmetics and paints.Waste can be stored at high pH to decrease the solubility of lead particulates in the water.Lead can damage the brain and kidneys if it is digested. Regulations to restrict the use of lead in plumbing, cosmetics and paints are put in place to reduce lead pollution.Human activities like oil refineries, cement production, and incomplete fossil fuel combustion release dangerous mercury (Hg) particulates into the atmosphere. These particulates can be inhaled by humans or make their way into aquatic ecosystems and be consumed by fish.The transition to renewable sources away from fossil fuels is key to reducing mercury emissions.Mercury ingestion can cause memory loss and brain damage.Pollution control type: transitioning to non-release pollutionMany of the types of control covered in this article are reactionary - meaning that they are only implemented once the pollution has been released/emitted. In order to make significant reductions in the amount of pollution we release, we need to shift to pollution prevention methods.It is straightforward: if we do not release pollution in the first place, it will not damage the environment, and we will not have to expend energy and resources to remove it.Examples of the types of controls for preventing pollution from the source include shifting to renewable energy (such as wind, solar, and geothermal power) and electric vehicles.Pollutant control - Key takeawaysPollutant control involves limiting or eradicating pollution in the form of emissions and waste. The three principles of pollutant control are accountability (whoever is responsible should deal with the pollution), prevention (pollution should be prevented before it is released), and individual responsibility (duty to protect and care for our planet).There are a variety of measures taken to control pollutants:The Clean Air Act of 1956 implemented regulations for emissions from vehicles and chimneys. Sorbents are sued in the desulphurisation of flue gases. Catalytic converters in cars reduce nitrous oxides and oxidise hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.Sedimentation removes the organic content of waste and reduces nutrient pollution."],

   '\xa0Tribal societies put the community before the individual, sharing and exchanging possessions rather than amassing personal wealth': ['Money isn’t the key to happiness. A group of Maasai people from east Africa were found to have a similar life satisfaction rating to those on the Forbes 400 richest Americans list.Hunter-gatherer tribes spend far less time working than we do. The Cuiva people of Colombia and Venezuela “work” for only 15-20 hours a week and spend many hours each day in their hammocks, made extra large so that spouses and children can all get in together.\xa0Peace comes from dismissing concepts of ownership, competition, vanity and greed, according to the Piaroa people of Venezuela. They disavow violence, hold men and women to be of equal status, and never physically punish children.\xa0The Hadza people of Tanzania value equality highly and have no official leaders. For them it is a moral obligation to give what you have without expectation of return. If you have more personal possessions than you have immediate use for, you should share them.Yanomami hunters never eat their own catch. They give it away to others before they even bring it home. In turn, they only eat what the other hunters have given to them. Everyone eats something provided by someone else, fostering community spirit and cohesion.Tribal societies possess an unparalleled understanding of some of the world’s most unique animals and ecosystems.Tribal peoples have unique relationships with animals. The Baka people of central Africa have more than 15 different words for “elephant” depending on the animal’s age, sex and temperament, and believe their ancestors walk with the animals through the forest.A Baka girl in Republic of Congo\xa0©\xa0SurvivalEvidence shows that the best barrier to deforestation in the Amazon is protecting the territories of uncontacted tribes. There are around 100 uncontacted tribes living in this rainforest and, as hunter-gatherers, they’re uniquely in tune with their environment and have vast botanical and zoological expertise.\xa0When they harvest honey from high in the trees, the Soliga people take some for themselves and leave some near the ground for tigers, who they consider family, because tigers cannot climb the trees and harvest honey for themselves.When a child is born to the Orang Rimba tribe of Indonesia, the umbilical cord is planted under a Sentubung tree. The child has a sacred bond with that tree for the rest of their life, and for the Orang Rimba, cutting down a “birth tree” is equivalent to murder.Click here to support tribal and Indigenous peoples in conservationTo plow land is to “scratch the breast” of Mother Earth, say India’s Baiga people, believing God created the forests to provide everything humans need and gave the Baiga wisdom to find it. Only people that God didn’t give this knowledge to must farm to survive.India’s Niyamgiri Hills soak up the monsoon’s rain, giving rise to more than a hundred perennial streams and rivers, including the Vamshadhara river. The Dongria Kondh tribe who inhabit this lush landscape call themselves “Jharnia”, meaning Protector of Streams.©\xa0Jason Taylor/SurvivalUnlike us, the Arhuaco people of Colombia’s Sierra Nevada take great responsibility for the wellbeing of the planet, seeing it as their job to keep Mother Earth in harmony. They see droughts and famines as a consequence of human failure to keep the world in balance.Many tribal societies embrace gender equality; they show us that our society’s gender norms are not “natural” but culturally specificWomen were traditionally the main breadwinners among the Chambri people of Papua New Guinea. They did all the fishing and took the extra fish they caught out into the surrounding hills to trade with other tribes. Neither sex is seen as dominant in Chambri life.Bayaka fathers spend approximately half the day near their babies. They even offer them a nipple to suck if the child is crying, and the mother or another woman is not available. It is not uncommon to wake in the night and hear a father singing to his child.Monogamy is not a universal human trait. The Zo’é people of the Amazon are polygamous, both men and women may have more than one partner. Everyone is equal in Zo’é society and traditionally there were no leaders. All wear the ‘m’berpót’ – a long wooden lip plug.A Zo’é family relaxes in a hammock they made from Brazil nut fibres.\xa0©\xa0Fiona Watson/SurvivalMany Native American societies traditionally recognised three genders. The third gender, “Two Spirit”, was seen as blessed; possessing unique insight thanks to their understanding of both masculine and feminine perspectives.\xa0Women in industrial societies are still fighting for equality, but equal status of the sexes is normal for many hunter-gathers, like the Awá tribe in the Brazilian Amazon. Awá women participate in hunting trips and can even take several husbands.\xa0Click here to support Brazil’s tribal and Indigenous peoplesThe level of power and independence enjoyed by the Innu women of Canada scandalized Catholic missionaries, who, up until the mid 20th century, tried to impose European standards, and make Innu women subservient to their husbands.Not everyone considers women’s breasts to be indecent; for many tribes they are unremarkable, and other body parts may be taboo instead. Emberá women in Colombia may go topless, but they must always cover the sides of their thighs.\xa0The Wodaabe people in northern Niger hold a male beauty contest every year at the end of the rainy season. Young men wear makeup, jewelry and their best clothes and line up to compete for the attention of the women.Tribal societies have developed extraordinary expertise and unique technologies to live sustainably in some of the most challenging environments on the planetMany tribes around the world, like the Penan people of Sarawak, use clever chemistry to fish sustainably. They use toxins from plants to stun fish, which then float to the surface. People can take only what they need and allow the smaller fish to recover and swim away so fish stocks aren’t depleted.Special honeycomb is used to make casts for broken limbs by the Chenchu people of south-east India. They also say they never collect honey during the rains, because the bees will find it difficult to set up a new home while the rocks are slippery.Chenchu have a reciprocal relationship with the forest, based on the respect for cycles of the nature and in the responsibility for the future generations. Their customs dictate that they should never take more than they need or waste anything.\xa0©\xa0SurvivalSirius is the brightest star in the sky and has a hidden partner. Sirius B is invisible to the naked eye and was only discovered by Western scientists in the 19th century. But it has been reported that the Dogon people of Mali may have known about the star before and understood its 50 year orbital period.Himba women of of Namibia and Angola cover themselves with otjize paste, a mixture of fat and ochre, cleansing to the skin and hair without water. Otjize also protects against the sun and mosquito bites, but the women say they just wear it to look good!\xa0A moon halo – a bright ring visible around the moon when there are ice crystals in the air – was used by Indigenous peoples all over Australia as a weather predictor. Australia was once populated by up to a million people who spoke over 250 languages.\xa0The spectacular Baliem Valley in West Papua is home to the Dani people, who are said to have developed agriculture at least 9,000 years ago, probably far in advance of Europe.\xa0The Guugu Ymithirr people of Australia traditionally had no words for left and right and only used North, South, East and West for direction. They oriented themselves instinctively, able to use each compass point accurately relative to where they were standing.\xa0Click here to help Indigenous languages thriveThe Jumma peoples of Bangladesh allow their precious land to recover by ‘shifting cultivation’; growing food in small parts of their territory, before moving on to another area. They put a mix of seeds in each hole for different crops in different seasons.Marma mother and son sitting outside their home. In the last 60 years, the Jumma tribes have gone from being practically the sole inhabitants of the Chittagong Hill Tracts to being almost outnumbered by settlers.\xa0©\xa0Mark McEvoy/SurvivalAs a form of contraception, men from some tribes in West Papua have traditionally drunk a tea made from a plant called Gendarussa. Scientists are investigating whether the plant could provide the basis for a contraceptive pill for men.\xa0Malaria is one of the world’s most deadly diseases. Quinine, made from the bark of Cinchona trees, has been vital in the fight against it and was first used medicinally by Indigenous peoples like the Quechua of Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador as a muscle relaxant.Their understanding of their environment and ability to interpret natural phenomena saved the tribal peoples of the Andaman Islands from the devastation of the 2004 Asian Tsunami. There were over 200,000 deaths as a result of the tsunami, but no tribal people died.They show us that the range of human ability, perception, and experience is so much broader than what exists in our societyThe Shipibo people of the Peruvian Amazon make intricate geometric art that can be read as music. The people can “hear” the song by looking at the patterns, like sheet music. The patterns represent chants and songs associated with Ayahasca healing ceremonies.\xa0The sea-faring Bajau people of Malaysia can hold their breath for up to 3 minutes and free-dive up to 20 meters. Scientists found that the Bajau are submerged for up to 60% of the time they spend in the water, which is nearly as long as a sea-otter.\xa0English is perhaps not such a difficult language to learn, it only uses around 42 different sounds. ǃXóõ, a language spoken by ‘Bushman’ tribes\xa0in the Kalahari Desert, has over 160. This includes five different “click” sounds originally found only in Bushman languages.Botswana Bushmen, Kalahari, Kua tribe\xa0©\xa0Forest Woodward / Survival, 2015Many tribes use naturally-occurring psychoactive substances to sharpen their abilities, both mentally and physically. Matsés men and women often use frog poison before hunting trips to produce a feeling of clarity, vision and strength that can last for several days.In a harsh sub-polar climate with temperatures around freezing, the former Indigenous inhabitants of Tierra Del Fuego at the southernmost tip of Argentina could often go without clothes, slept outside, and swam in water cold enough to kill Europeans.The future is behind you and the past in front of you, according to Aymara people of the Andes. You can “see” the past, but you cannot see the future. The Aymara word for past literally means eye, sight or front, and the word for future means “behind” or “the back.”\xa0Are you at your mental peak at midnight? Sleeping all night just isn’t how everyone does it. The Pirahã people of Amazonas don’t just pass out for 8 hours at 11pm, they take naps at any time throughout the day or night.\xa0The Rarámuri people of Mexico developed a tradition of long-distance running, up to 200 miles at a time, for inter-village communication, transportation, and hunting. They live in challenging mountainous terrain with large distances between settlements.The Guarani language has two different words for “we”. One “we” includes the people you are talking to, a bit like saying “me and you”. The other, you use to talk about a group of people who are not present, kind of like “me and them”\xa0The Guarani use urucum dye of the annatto shrub to paint their faces and bodies during festivities, Brazil.\xa0©\xa0Fiona Watson/SurvivalThe Moken people of the Andaman Sea have remarkable visual skills. Their aquatic lifestyles mean they have developed the unique ability to focus under water in order to dive for food on the sea floor. Their sight is 50% more acute than Europeans’Have you ever been so excited to see someone, you keep going outside to check if they’ve arrived yet? The Inuktitut language of the Inuit has a word for that: “Iktsuarpok”, pronounced eekt-soo-ahh-pohk.\xa0Tribal and Indigenous societies are a vital part of human diversityThe most diverse place on Earth is the island of New Guinea, inhabited by around 1,000 or so different tribes. Though only about 0.1% of the world’s population lives here, it’s the home of approximately one seventh of the world’s 7,000 languages.\xa0There are 100 or so uncontacted tribes in South America and all of them live in the Amazon… except one. The Totobiegosode of Paraguay are a sub-group of the Ayoreo people and some of them have chosen to reject interaction with mainstream society.\xa0Click here to support uncontacted tribes’ right to live as they want toUncontacted tribes don’t necessarily want “our” way of life. In 2014, three uncontacted Awá people left the forest to engage with mainstream society. Unimpressed, two of them later returned to their forest, covering their tracks so they could not be followed.\xa0Colombia’s most recently contacted tribe, the Nukak, traditionally used piranha teeth to cut their hair. The tribe were uncontacted until 1988, when they turned up unexpectedly in a newly-established town inside the Nukak’s territory.©\xa0Survival InternationalDo you talk to your pets? The Bodi people of Ethiopia sing special poems to their favorite cows. The tribe are agro-pastoralists, whose livelihoods and culture revolve around their cattle.The Sentinelese people have likely been almost entirely isolated on their island for many centuries. Their nearest neighbors, the Jarawa, can’t understand the Sentinelese language, indicating these related groups must have been separated for hundreds of years.\xa0The Enawene Nawe tribe of Brazil practice one of the longest ritual celebrations on Earth, lasting over 4 months. They build intricate wooden dams across rivers to catch fish migrating from their spawning grounds. After the ritual ends, the dams are destroyed.As far as we know, the ancestors of today’s ‘Bushman’ tribes in southern Africa were in the region tens of thousands of years before anyone else. They have probably lived on their lands longer than anyone else has lived anywhere.'],

   'Essentials': [],
   '\rThe natural greenhouse effect': ["The natural greenhouse effect is a phenomenon caused by gases naturally present in the atmosphere that affect the behaviour of the heat energy radiated by the sun. In simple terms, sunlight (shortwave radiation) passes through the atmosphere, and is absorbed by Earth’s surface. This warms Earth’s surface, and then Earth radiates some of this energy (as infrared, or longwave radiation) back towards space. As it passes through the atmosphere, gases such as (water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide absorb most of the energy. The energy is then re-emitted in all directions, so some energy escapes into space, but less than would have escaped if the atmosphere and its greenhouse gases weren’t there. The result is that some of the sun's energy becomes ‘trapped’—making the lower part of the atmosphere, and Earth, warmer than it would be otherwise."],
   'Earth’s energy balance': ['The rate at which energy is absorbed by Earth is approximately balanced by the rate at which it is emitted back into space, keeping the Earth in what’s known as a state of equilibrium, and at a stable temperature. As long as the amount of greenhouse gases in the air stays the same, and the rate of energy arriving from the sun is constant, this equilibrium is maintained. In the state of equilibrium that existed during the centuries up until Industrial Revolution, which started in the late 1700s, the natural greenhouse effect maintained the average temperature of Earth’s surface at around 15°C.'],
   'Carbon dioxide (CO2)': ["The increase in CO2 is partly caused by fossil-fuel burning, cement manufacture, land clearing, forest harvesting and changes in agricultural practice. According to the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory of 2011, CO2 accounts for 74 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions."],
   'Methane': ["Emissions from landfill, biomass burning, increased agricultural production in rice paddy fields, digestive fermentation (burps and farts) from cattle and other livestock, and leaks from natural gas pipelines and coal mines have led to a steady increase in methane emissions. Methane production accounts for 20 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, and emissions of this gas have increased at a faster rate than CO2. Scientists are concerned that global warming will result in the release of even more methane if permafrost melts."],
   'Nitrous oxide': ["There are many small sources of this gas, both natural and manufactured, that are difficult to quantify. The main sources created by human activity are agriculture (especially the development of pastures in tropical regions), biomass burning and a number of industrial processes. Nitrous oxide production accounts for 4 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions."],
   'Halocarbons': ["Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are halocarbons which were widely used for propellants, refrigerants, and foaming agents. Their use rapidly increased after their invention in the 1930s. The realisation that they were responsible for ozone depletion in the stratosphere has led to their phasing out under the 1987 Montreal Protocol. Perfluorocarbons, another type of halocarbon, are produced during aluminium production. Halocarbon production accounts for 1.1 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions."],
   'The composition of the atmosphere is changing': ["Earth's atmosphere is made up of 78 per cent nitrogen and 21 per cent oxygen. Only about 1 per cent is made up of natural greenhouse gases, but this comparatively small amount of gas makes a big difference. The Industrial Revolution brought new industrial processes, an increase in the burning of fossil fuels, more extensive agriculture, and a rapid increase in the world's population. This rapid increase in human activity led to the (still ongoing) emission of significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. We know this because of measurements made over the past 50 years and the analysis of air bubbles trapped in ancient ice, which show that levels of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and halocarbons are increasing."],
   '\rThe enhanced greenhouse effect and climate change': ['The disruption to Earth’s climate equilibrium caused by the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases has led to an increase in the global average surface temperatures. This process is called the enhanced greenhouse effect.'],
   '\rPredicting the future is difficult': ['While the basic physics of the greenhouse effect is reasonably well understood, predicting the future course of events is made difficult because of our limited knowledge about future greenhouse gas emissions and the detailed behaviour of the atmosphere and oceans. The climate system is extremely complicated, with many inter-connected ‘feed-back’ processes at work which can either magnify or reduce the original effect.'],
   '\rA national and international issue': ['An increase in global temperature would bring changes to the entire planet, and therefore to every nation. This makes it an international issue which needs worldwide study and responses. Australia’s contribution to global CO2\xa0emissions in 2012 was only around 1 per cent, but our\xa0per capita CO2\xa0production\xa0puts us among the top of the OECD countries.'],
   'Global emissions per capita': [],
   'Australian scientists': ["Australian scientists are working on many aspects of the greenhouse effect. Some scientists try to determine climatic trends, or model the effect of the enhanced greenhouse effect on Australia's climate and economy. Others work on the Antarctic ice cap, to see what impact the enhanced greenhouse effect may be having there. A number of Australian scientists have contributed to the World Climate Research Programme, and the development of the\xa0Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports. All this is part of a worldwide attempt to better understand the enhanced greenhouse effect and climate change and to decide what can be done about it."],

Its modern name derives from its location in the valley of the Indus River, but it is also commonly referred to as the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization and the Harrapan Civilization.These latter designations come from the Sarasvati River mentioned in Vedic sources, which flowed adjacent to the Indus River, and the ancient city of Harappa in the region, the first one found in the modern era. None of these names derive from any ancient texts because, although scholars generally believe the people of this civilization developed a writing system (known as Indus Script or Harappan Script) it has not yet been deciphered.Remove AdsAdvertisementAll three designations are modern constructs, and nothing is definitively known of the origin, development, decline, and fall of the civilization. Even so, modern archaeology has established a probable chronology and periodization:YouTubeFollow us on YouTube!// Remove Primis player on mobilefunction handlePrimisPlayerRemoval() {if (document.getElementById(\'primis_intext\') && !get_media_layout().includes(\'desktop\')) {document.getElementById(\'primis_intext\').remove();console.log(\'Primis player removed...\');}}handlePrimisPlayerRemoval();window.addEventListener("resize",(event) => {handlePrimisPlayerRemoval();},{passive: true});Pre-Harappan – c. 7000 - c. 5500 BCEEarly Harappan – c. 5500 - 2800 BCEMature Harappan – c. 2800 - c. 1900 BCELate Harappan – c. 1900 - c. 1500 BCEPost Harappan – c. 1500 - c. 600 BCEThe Indus Valley Civilization is now often compared with the far more famous cultures of Egypt and Mesopotamia, but this is a fairly recent development. The discovery of Harappa in 1829 CE was the first indication that any such civilization existed in India, and by that time, Egyptian hieroglyphics had been deciphered, Egyptian and Mesopotamian sites excavated, and cuneiform would soon be translated by the scholar George Smith (l. 1840-1876 CE). Archaeological excavations of the Indus Valley Civilization, therefore, had a significantly late start comparatively, and it is now thought that many of the accomplishments and “firsts” attributed to Egypt and Mesopotamia may actually belong to the people of the Indus Valley Civilization.Remove AdsAdvertisementThe total population of the civilization is thought to have been upward of 5 million, & its territory stretched over 900 miles (1,500 km) along the Indus River.The two best-known excavated cities of this culture are Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (located in modern-day Pakistan), both of which are thought to have once had populations of between 40,000-50,000 people, which is stunning when one realizes that most ancient cities had on average 10,000 people living in them. The total population of the civilization is thought to have been upward of 5 million, and its territory stretched over 900 miles (1,500 km) along the banks of the Indus River and then in all directions outward. Indus Valley Civilization sites have been found near the border of Nepal, in Afghanistan, on the coasts of India, and around Delhi, to name only a few locations.Between c. 1900 - c. 1500 BCE, the civilization began to decline for unknown reasons. In the early 20th century CE, this was thought to have been caused by an invasion of light-skinned peoples from the north known as Aryans who conquered a dark-skinned people defined by Western scholars as Dravidians. This claim, known as the Aryan Invasion Theory, has been discredited. The Aryans – whose ethnicity is associated with the Iranian Persians – are now believed to have migrated to the region peacefully and blended their culture with that of the indigenous people while the term Dravidian is understood now to refer to anyone, of any ethnicity, who speaks one of the Dravidian languages.Love History?Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!Why the Indus Valley Civilization declined and fell is unknown, but scholars believe it may have had to do with climate change, the drying up of the Sarasvati River, an alteration in the path of the monsoon which watered crops, overpopulation of the cities, a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia, or a combination of any of the above. In the present day, excavations continue at many of the sites found thus far and some future find may provide more information on the history and decline of the culture.Discovery & Early ExcavationThe symbols and inscriptions on the artifacts of the people of the Indus Valley Civilization, which have been interpreted by some scholars as a writing system, remain undeciphered and so archaeologists generally avoid defining an origin for the culture as any attempt would be speculative. All that can be known of the civilization to date comes from the physical evidence excavated at various sites. The story of the Indus Valley Civilization, therefore, is best given with the discovery of its ruins in the 19th century CE.James Lewis (better known as Charles Masson, l. 1800-1853 CE) was a British soldier serving in the artillery of the East India Company Army when, in 1827 CE, he deserted with another soldier. In order to avoid detection by authorities, he changed his name to Charles Masson and embarked on a series of travels throughout India. Masson was an avid numismatist (coin collector) who was especially interested in old coins and, in following various leads, wound up excavating ancient sites on his own. One of these sites was Harappa, which he found in 1829 CE. He seems to have left the site fairly quickly, after making a record of it in his notes but, having no knowledge of who could have built the city, wrongly attributed it to Alexander the Great during his campaigns in India c. 326 BCE.Remove AdsAdvertisementIndus Valley Civilization - Mature Harappan PhaseAvantiputra7 (CC BY-SA){"@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/12853/indus-valley-civilization---mature-harappan-phase/#imageobject","@type":"ImageObject","acquireLicensePage":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/12853/indus-valley-civilization---mature-harappan-phase/","caption":"Map of the Indus Valley Civilization, Mature Harappan Phase","contentUrl":"https://www.worldhistory.org/uploads/images/12853.png","copyrightNotice":"Avantiputra7 - CC BY-SA - This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon a work even for commercial reasons, as long as they credit the author and license their new creations under the identical terms.

Sir Alexander Cunningham (l. 1814-1893 CE), a British engineer in the country with a passion for ancient history, founded the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1861 CE, an organization dedicated to maintaining a professional standard of excavation and preservation of historic sites. Cunningham began excavations of the site and published his interpretation in 1875 CE (in which he identified and named the Indus Script) but this was incomplete and lacked definition because Harappa remained isolated with no connection to any known past civilization which could have built it.In 1904 CE, a new director of the ASI was appointed, John Marshall (l. 1876-1958 CE), who later visited Harappa and concluded the site represented an ancient civilization previously unknown. He ordered the site to be fully excavated and, at about the same time, heard of another site some miles away which the local people referred to as Mohenjo-daro (“the mound of the dead”) because of bones, both animal and human, found there along with various artifacts. Excavations at Mohenjo-daro began in the 1924-1925 season and the similarities of the two sites were recognized; the Indus Valley Civilization had been discovered.Harappa & Mohenjo-daroThe Hindu texts known as the Vedas, as well as other great works of Indian tradition such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana, were already well known to Western scholars but they did not know what culture had created them. Systemic racism of the time prevented them from attributing the works to the people of India, and the same, at first, led archaeologists to conclude that Harappa was a colony of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia or perhaps an Egyptian outpost.Remove AdsAdvertisementHarappaMuhammad Bin Naveed (CC BY-SA){"@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/12857/harappa/#imageobject","@type":"ImageObject","acquireLicensePage":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/12857/harappa/","caption":"Archaeological site of Harappa in modern-day Pakistan, one of the best-known cities of the Indus Valley Civilization.","contentUrl":"https://www.worldhistory.org/uploads/images/12857.jpg","copyrightNotice":"Muhammad Bin Naveed - CC BY-SA - This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon a work even for commercial reasons, as long as they credit the author and license their new creations under the identical terms.

The city spread over 370 acres (150 hectares) of small, brick houses with flat roofs made of clay. There was a citadel, walls, the streets were laid out in a grid pattern clearly demonstrating a high degree of skill in urban planning and, in comparing the two sites, it was apparent to the excavators that they were dealing with a highly advanced culture.Houses in both cities had flush toilets, a sewer system, and fixtures on either side of the streets were part of an elaborate drainage system, which was more advanced even than that of the early Romans. Devices known from Persia as “wind catchers” were attached to the roofs of some buildings which provided air conditioning for the home or administrative office and, at Mohenjo-daro, there was a great public bath, surrounded by a courtyard, with steps leading down into it.As other sites were unearthed, the same degree of sophistication and skill came to light as well as the understanding that all of these cities had been pre-planned. Unlike those of other cultures which usually developed from smaller, rural communities, the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization had been thought out, a site chosen, and purposefully constructed prior to full habitation. Further, they all exhibited conformity to a single vision which further suggested a strong central government with an efficient bureaucracy that could plan, fund, and build such cities. Scholar John Keay comments:Remove AdsAdvertisementWhat amazed all these pioneers, and what remains the distinctive characteristic of the several hundred Harappan sites now known, is their apparent similarity: “Our overwhelming impression is of cultural uniformity, both throughout the several centuries during which the Harappan civilization flourished, and over the vast area it occupied.” The ubiquitous bricks, for instance, are all of standardized dimensions, just as the stone cubes used by the Harappans to measure weights are also standard and based on the modular system. Road widths conform to a similar module; thus, streets are typically twice the width of side lanes, while the main arteries are twice or one and a half times the width of streets. Most of the streets so far excavated are straight and run either north-south or east-west. City plans therefore conform to a regular grid pattern and appear to have retained this layout through several phases of building. (9)Excavations at both sites continued between 1944-1948 CE under the direction of the British archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler (l. 1890-1976 CE) whose racialist ideology made it difficult for him to accept that dark-skinned people had built the cities. Even so, he managed to establish stratigraphy for Harappa and lay the foundation for the later periodization of the Indus Valley Civilization.Great Bath, Mohenjo-daroBenny Lin (CC BY-NC){"@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/12854/great-bath-mohenjo-daro/#imageobject","@type":"ImageObject","acquireLicensePage":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/12854/great-bath-mohenjo-daro/","caption":"Mohenjo-daro is one of the best-known cities of the Indus Valley Civilization.

The chronology is primarily based, as noted, on physical evidence from Harappan sites but also from knowledge of their trade contacts with Egypt and Mesopotamia. Lapis lazuli, to name only one product, was immensely popular in both cultures and, although scholars knew it came from India, they did not know from precisely where until the Indus Valley Civilization was discovered. Even though this semi-precious stone would continue to be imported after the fall of the Indus Valley Civilization, it is clear that, initially, some of the export came from this region.Pre-Harappan – c. 7000 - c. 5500 BCE: The Neolithic period best exemplified by sites like Mehrgarh which shows evidence of agricultural development, domestication of plants and animals, and production of tools and ceramics.Early Harappan – c. 5500-2800 BCE: Trade firmly established with Egypt, Mesopotamia, and possibly China. Ports, docks, and warehouses built near waterways by communities living in small villages.Mature Harappan – c. 2800 - c. 1900 BCE: Construction of the great cities and widespread urbanization. Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are both flourishing c. 2600 BCE. Other cities, such as Ganeriwala, Lothal, and Dholavira are built according to the same models and this development of the land continues with the construction of hundreds of other cities until there are over 1,000 of them throughout the land in every direction.Late Harappan – c. 1900 - c. 1500 BCE: Decline of the civilization coinciding with a wave of migration of the Aryan people from the north, most likely the Iranian Plateau. Physical evidence suggests climate change which caused flooding, drought, and famine. A loss of trade relations with Egypt and Mesopotamia has also been suggested as a contributing cause.Post Harappan – c. 1500 - c. 600 BCE: The cities are abandoned, and the people have moved south. The civilization has already fallen by the time Cyrus II (the Great, r. c. 550-530 BCE) invades India in 530 BCE.Harappan Civilization (Artist\'s Impression)Amplitude Studios (Copyright){"@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/16181/harappan-civilization-artists-impression/#imageobject","@type":"ImageObject","acquireLicensePage":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/16181/harappan-civilization-artists-impression/","caption":"An artist\'s impression of Harappa and the Indus Valley Civilization, depicting fields and cities in ancient India.

There is no evidence of a standing army, no palaces, and no temples. The Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro is believed to have been used for ritual purification rites related to religious belief but this is conjecture; it could as easily have been a public pool for recreation. Each city seems to have had its own governor but, it is speculated, there must have been some form of centralized government in order to achieve the uniformity of the cities. John Keay comments:Harappan tools, utensils, and materials confirm this impression of uniformity. Unfamiliar with iron – which was nowhere known in the third millennium BC – the Harappans sliced, scraped, beveled, and bored with \'effortless competence\' using a standardized kit of tools made from chert, a kind of quartz, or from copper and bronze. These last, along with gold and silver, were the only metals available. They were also used for casting vessels and statuettes and for fashioning a variety of knives, fishhooks, arrowheads, saws, chisels, sickles, pins, and bangles. (10)Among the thousands of artifacts discovered at the various sites are small, soapstone seals a little over an inch (3 cm) in diameter which archaeologists interpret to have been used for personal identification in trade. Like the cylinder seals of Mesopotamia, these seals are thought to have been used to sign contracts, authorize land sales, and authenticate point-of-origin, shipment, and receipt of goods in trade long distance.Unicorn Seal - Indus ScriptMukul Banerjee (Copyright){"@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/2977/unicorn-seal---indus-script/#imageobject","@type":"ImageObject","acquireLicensePage":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/2977/unicorn-seal---indus-script/","caption":"A seal with Indus Script, c. 2700-2000 BCE.","contentUrl":"https://www.worldhistory.org/uploads/images/2977.jpg","copyrightNotice":"Mukul Banerjee - Copyright - You cannot use, copy, distribute, or modify this item without explicit permission from the author.","creator":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mukul Banerjee"},"creditText":"Mukul Banerjee / Flickr","dateModified":"2023-09-24T05:35:11+0000","datePublished":"2014-08-28T11:49:24+0000","encodingFormat":"image/jpeg","headline":"Unicorn Seal - Indus Script","height":1469,"isAccessibleForFree":true,"isBasedOn":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mukulb/8082717257/"},"isFamilyFriendly":true,"isPartOf":"https://www.worldhistory.org#website","license":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/2977/unicorn-seal---indus-script/","publisher":"https://www.worldhistory.org#organization","representativeOfPage":false,"url":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/2977/unicorn-seal---indus-script/","width":1600}The people had developed the wheel, carts drawn by cattle, flat-bottomed boats wide enough to transport trade goods, and may have also developed the sail. In agriculture, they understood and made use of irrigation techniques and canals, various farming implements, and established different areas for cattle grazing and crops. Fertility rituals may have been observed for a full harvest as well as pregnancies of women as evidenced by a number of figurines, amulets, and statuettes in female form. It is thought that the people may have worshipped a Mother Goddess deity and, possibly, a male consort depicted as a horned figure in the company of wild animals. The religious beliefs of the culture, however, are unknown and any suggestions must be speculative.Their level of artistic skill is evident through numerous finds of statuary, soapstone seals, ceramics, and jewelry. The most famous artwork is the bronze statuette, standing 4 inches (10 cm) tall, known as “Dancing Girl” found at Mohenjo-daro in 1926 CE. The piece shows a teenage girl, right hand on her hip, left on her knee, with chin raised as though evaluating the claims of a suitor. An equally impressive piece is a soapstone figure, 6 inches (17 cm) tall, known as the Priest-King, depicting a bearded man wearing a headdress and ornamental armband.Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-daroJoe Ravi (CC BY-SA){"@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/360/dancing-girl-of-mohenjo-daro/#imageobject","@type":"ImageObject","acquireLicensePage":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/360/dancing-girl-of-mohenjo-daro/","caption":"Replica of \'Dancing Girl\' of Mohenjo-daro at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya in Mumbai, India.","contentUrl":"https://www.worldhistory.org/uploads/images/360.jpg","copyrightNotice":"Joe Ravi - CC BY-SA - This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon a work even for commercial reasons, as long as they credit the author and license their new creations under the identical terms.

There are many different images on these seals but, as Keay notes, the unicorn appears on "1156 seals and sealings out of a total of 1755 found at Mature Harappan sites" (17). He also notes that the seals, no matter what image appears on them, also have markings which have been interpreted as Indus Script, suggesting that the “writing” conveys a meaning different from the image. The “unicorn” could possibly have represented an individual\'s family, clan, city, or political affiliation and the “writing” one\'s personal information.Decline & Aryan Invasion TheoryJust as there is no definitive answer to the question of what the seals were, what the “unicorn” represented, or how the people venerated their gods, there is none for why the culture declined and fell. Between c. 1900 - c. 1500 BCE, the cities were steadily abandoned, and the people moved south. As noted, there are a number of theories concerning this, but none are completely satisfactory. According to one, the Gaggar-Hakra River, which is identified with the Sarasvati River from Vedic texts, and which ran adjacent to the Indus River, dried up c. 1900 BCE, necessitating a major relocation of the people who had depended on it. Significant silting at sites such as Mohenjo-daro suggests major flooding which is given as another cause.Priest-king from Mohenjo-daroMamoon Mengal (CC BY-SA){"@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/12858/priest-king-from-mohenjo-daro/#imageobject","@type":"ImageObject","acquireLicensePage":"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/12858/priest-king-from-mohenjo-daro/","caption":"Priest-king statue, Indus Valley Civilization.

Both Mesopotamia and Egypt were experiencing troubles during this same time which could have resulted in a significant disruption in trade. The Late Harappan Period corresponds roughly with the Middle Bronze Age in Mesopotamia (2119-1700 BCE) during which the Sumerians – the major trading partners with the people of the Indus Valley – were engaged in driving out the Gutian invaders and, between c. 1792-1750 BCE, the Babylonian king Hammurabi was conquering their city-states as he consolidated his empire. In Egypt, the period corresponds to the latter part of the Middle Kingdom (2040-1782 BCE) when the weak 13th Dynasty ruled just prior to the coming of the Hyksos and the central government\'s loss of power and authority.The reason which early 20th century CE scholars seized on, however, was none of these but the claim that the Indus Valley people had been conquered and driven south by an invasion of a superior race of light-skinned Aryans.Aryan Invasion TheoryWestern scholars had been translating and interpreting the Vedic literature of India for over 200 years by the time Wheeler was excavating the sites and, in that time, came to develop the theory that the subcontinent was at some point conquered by a light-skinned race known as Aryans who established high culture throughout the land. This theory developed slowly and, at first, innocently through the publication of a work by the Anglo-Welsh philologist Sir William Jones (l. 1746-1794 CE) in 1786 CE. Jones, an avid reader of Sanskrit, noted that there were remarkable similarities between it and European languages and claimed there had to be a common source for all of them; he called this source Proto-Indo-European.Later Western scholars, trying to identify Jones\' “common source”, concluded that a light-skinned race from the north – somewhere around Europe – had conquered the lands south, notably India, establishing culture and spreading their language and customs, even though nothing, objectively, supported this view. A French elitist writer named Joseph Arthur de Gobineau (l. 1816-1882 CE) popularized this view in his work An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races in 1855 CE and asserted that superior, light-skinned, races had “Aryan blood” and were naturally disposed to rule over lesser races.The early Iranians self-identified as Aryan, meaning “noble” or “free” or “civilized”, until it was corrupted by European racists to serve their own agenda.Gobineau\'s book was admired by the German composer Richard Wagner (l. 1813-1883 CE) whose British-born son-in-law, Houston Stewart Chamberlain (l. 1855-1927 CE) further popularized these views in his work which would eventually influence Adolf Hitler and the architect of the Nazi ideology, Alfred Rosenberg (l. 1893-1946 CE). These racialist views were given further validity by a German philologist and scholar who did not share them, Max Muller (l. 1823-1900 CE), the so-called “author” of the Aryan Invasion Theory who insisted, in all of his work, that Aryan had to do with a linguistic difference and had nothing at all to do with ethnicity.It hardly mattered what Muller said, however, because, by the time Wheeler was excavating the sites in the 1940s CE, people had been breathing in these theories with the air of the times for well over 50 years. It would be decades more before the majority of scholars, writers, and academics would begin to recognize that \'Aryan\' originally referred to a class of people – having nothing to do with race – and, in the words of the archaeologist J. P. Mallory, “as an ethnic designation the word [Aryan] is most properly limited to the Indo-Iranians” (Farrokh, 17). The early Iranians self-identified as Aryan meaning “noble” or “free” or “civilized” and the term continued in use for over 2000 years until it was corrupted by European racists to serve their own agenda.Wheeler\'s interpretation of the sites was informed by and then validated the Aryan Invasion Theory. The Aryans were already recognized as the authors of the Vedas and other works but their dates in the region were too late to support the claim that they had built the impressive cities; perhaps, though, they had destroyed them. Wheeler was, of course, as aware of the Aryan Invasion Theory as any other archaeologist at the time and, through this lens, interpreted what he found as supporting it; in doing so, he validated the theory which then gained greater popularity and acceptance.ConclusionThe Aryan Invasion Theory, though still cited and advanced by those with a racialist agenda, lost credence in the 1960s CE through the work, primarily, of the American archaeologist George F. Dales who reviewed Wheeler\'s interpretations, visited the sites, and found no evidence to support it. The skeletons Wheeler had interpreted as dying a violent death in battle showed no such signs nor did the cities exhibit any damage associated with war.Further, there was no evidence of any kind of mobilization of a great army of the north nor of any conquest c. 1900 BCE in India. The Persians – the only ethnicity self-identifying as Aryan – were themselves a minority on the Iranian Plateau between c. 1900 - c. 1500 BCE and in no position to mount an invasion of any kind. It was therefore suggested that the “Aryan Invasion” was actually most likely a migration of Indo-Iranians who merged peacefully with the indigenous people of India, intermarried, and were assimilated into the culture.As excavations of the sites of the Indus Valley Civilization continue, more information will no doubt contribute to a better understanding of its history and development. Recognition of the culture\'s vast accomplishments and high level of technology and sophistication has been increasingly coming to light and gaining greater attention. Scholar Jeffrey D. Long expresses the general sentiment, writing, “there is much fascination with this civilization because of its high level of technological advancement” (198). Already, the Indus Valley Civilization is referenced as one of the three greatest of antiquity alongside Egypt and Mesopotamia, and future excavations will almost surely elevate its standing even higher.Did you like this definition?Related ContentBooksCite This WorkLicenseEditorial ReviewThis article has been reviewed for accuracy, reliability and adherence to academic standards prior to publication.'],
   'Discovery & Early Excavation': ['The symbols and inscriptions on the artifacts of the people of the Indus Valley Civilization, which have been interpreted by some scholars as a writing system, remain undeciphered and so archaeologists generally avoid defining an origin for the culture as any attempt would be speculative. All that can be known of the civilization to date comes from the physical evidence excavated at various sites. The story of the Indus Valley Civilization, therefore, is best given with the discovery of its ruins in the 19th century CE.'],
   'Harappa & Mohenjo-daro': ['The Hindu texts known as the Vedas, as well as other great works of Indian tradition such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana, were already well known to Western scholars but they did not know what culture had created them. Systemic racism of the time prevented them from attributing the works to the people of India, and the same, at first, led archaeologists to conclude that Harappa was a colony of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia or perhaps an Egyptian outpost.'],
   'Chronology': ["Wheeler's work provided archaeologists with the means to recognize approximate dates from the civilization's foundations through its decline and fall. The chronology is primarily based, as noted, on physical evidence from Harappan sites but also from knowledge of their trade contacts with Egypt and Mesopotamia. Lapis lazuli, to name only one product, was immensely popular in both cultures and, although scholars knew it came from India, they did not know from precisely where until the Indus Valley Civilization was discovered. Even though this semi-precious stone would continue to be imported after the fall of the Indus Valley Civilization, it is clear that, initially, some of the export came from this region."],
   'Aspects of Culture': ['The people seem to have been primarily artisans, farmers, and merchants. There is no evidence of a standing army, no palaces, and no temples. The Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro is believed to have been used for ritual purification rites related to religious belief but this is conjecture; it could as easily have been a public pool for recreation. Each city seems to have had its own governor but, it is speculated, there must have been some form of centralized government in order to achieve the uniformity of the cities. John Keay comments:'],

   "The Future of Space Exploration: India's Role \xa0Blogs Home": ['02 Sep 2023'],
   "Introduction to India's Space Program": ["In only six decades, India has rapidly ascended as a global frontrunner in space technology and exploration, with much credit attributed to the ISRO. The journey commenced in 1962 under the visionary guidance of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, with the program initially falling under the purview of the Department of Atomic Energy. The overarching objective of India's space endeavour was to harness space technology for national progress, simultaneously pursuing scientific research in space and venturing into planetary exploration.\rISRO's remarkable track record is a living testament to its accomplishments. The cadre of engineers and scientists at ISRO has crafted an array of launch vehicles, homegrown satellites, and associated technologies that cater to diverse domains such as Earth observation, communication, navigation, meteorology, and space science. Pivotal milestones encompass the creation and launch of the Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) to satisfy the telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search and rescue needs of India, the series of Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS) catering to the needs of the country in managing its natural resources, and the development and deployment of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), enabling the launch of both domestic and international satellites.\rISRO's laurels extend to space exploration as well, with feats like the Chandrayaan missions for lunar exploration, the Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) in 2013—India's inaugural interplanetary expedition—and the initiation of AstroSat in 2015, marking the country's first dedicated astronomical pursuit.\rThe celestial journey embarked upon by India finds its origins in studies undertaken in the 1920s by luminaries like S K Mitra, C V Raman, and Meghnad Saha. The 1960s witnessed the formal inauguration of India's space odyssey, materializing in the maiden rocket launch of 1963, steered by the guidance of Vikram Sarabhai. The inception of the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), orchestrated by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru and Vikram Sarabhai, eventually metamorphosed into the present-day ISRO in 1969.\rThrough its historical timeline, ISRO scripted numerous technological breakthroughs and initiated the launch of indigenous spacefaring entities. Hallmarks include the maiden flight of Aryabhata in 1975, which etched India into the ranks of spacefaring nations; the deployment of Rohini Satellite (RS-1) in 1980, solidifying India's standing as the sixth such nation; and the resounding triumph of the Chandrayaan lunar venture in 2008 (As India's Chandrayaan-1 played a crucial role in the discovery of water molecules on the Moon.). The Mangalyaan in 2013 further consolidated ISRO's stature as the fourth space agency to reach Mars.\rWhile there have been intermittent setbacks, exemplified by the SLV-3 launch in 1979 and the heat shield separation incident during the PSLV-C39 mission in 2017, India's cosmic journey has been a repository of invaluable insights and profound scientific discoveries. The preceding half-century has sown the seeds for even loftier achievements, with India's audacious plans for human space voyages and an ongoing commitment to enriching the frontiers of space exploration."],
   'Chandrayaan Mission 3 Success:\u202f': ["Traditionally, previous lunar missions gravitated toward the equatorial region due to its favourable conditions; however, Chandrayaan Mission 3 dared to navigate the formidable terrain of the lunar south pole. This calculated choice held remarkable importance. The lunar south pole introduces an entirely distinct and challenging landscape in comparison to the equatorial expanse. One of the defining characteristics of this region is the scarcity of sunlight, leading to the existence of perpetually dark zones where temperatures plummet to an astonishing -230 degrees Celsius. The absence of sunlight and the relentless cold pose formidable challenges to the operation of scientific instruments and the mission's overall sustainability."],
   'Prospects\u202fand Collaborations:\u202f': ["India's prospects in space exploration shine brightly, with an array of upcoming missions and collaborations poised to elevate the nation's standing on the global stage. Two missions that stand out with special emphasis are the Aditya L1 mission and the Gaganyaan mission."],

   'India’s Foreign Policy': ['18 Aug 202214 min read'],
   'What is the Difference Between State and Nation?': ['A State consists of four elements - population, territory, government, and sovereignty.\r\rWhile a Nation is a community based on shared ethnicity, history, traditions, and aspirations.\r\r\rAs a legal entity, the State is responsible for the security and welfare of its people, and it is concerned with external human actions.\r\rWhereas Nations are a unit of people who are united emotionally, spiritually, and psychologically.\r\r\rThe territory is also an essential part of the State, because it is the physical substance of the State.\r\rBut for a nation, the territory is not an essential part of the nation. A nation can survive without a fixed territory.\r\r\rIn some countries, such as America, Australia and Canada, the state comprises many nations, and they are ‘multinational societies’.'],
   "How does India's Foreign Policy Reflect Its Active National Interest?": ['India First Policy: With 75 years of independence, the country has a greater sense of confidence and optimism in articulating an "India First" foreign policy. India decides for itself, and its independent foreign policy cannot be subject to intimidations.\r\rWith one-fifth of the world\'s population, India has the right to have its own side and to weigh its own interests.\r\rIt is certainly a basic tenet of international relations that national interests are paramount, and India too, like other nations, has pursued its interests when it comes to foreign and national security policies.\r\r\r\r\rRealistic Diplomacy: Today’s self-confident India has a new voice in the global firmament, rooted in its domestic realities and civilizational ethos, as well as firm in the pursuit of its vital interests.\r\rAs the Indian Foreign Minister remarked at Raisina Dialogue, “It is better to engage with the world on the basis of “who we are" rather than try and please the world. India is confident about its identity and priorities, the world will engage with India on its terms.\r\r\rMaintaining Balance of Power to its Advantage: From being the only global power to challenge China’s Belt and Road Initiative as far back as 2014 to responding to Chinese military aggression with a strong military pushback.\r\rOn the other hand, working with the US without entering the full embrace of a formal alliance and engaging the West to build domestic capacities.\r\rIndia has been pragmatic to the core and willing to use the extant balance of power to its advantage.\r\r\r\r\rGrowing Economic Ties: Since India\'s economic interdependence with the rest of the world deepens, it has become more observant of markets for its products, sources of raw materials, and potential recipients of its expanding foreign aid.\rMulti Aligned Approach: From the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to the BRICS, there is a long list of memberships that India holds.\r\rOften this is seen as old-style meandering. India, however, is increasingly articulating and promoting its priorities in a much more direct manner.\r\r\rIntervention over Interference: India does not believe in interference in the internal affairs of other countries.\r\rHowever, if an act - innocent or deliberate - by any country has the potential of impinging upon India’s national interests, India does not hesitate in quick and timely intervention.'],
   'What are the Moral Aspects of India’s Foreign Policy?': ['Panchsheel (Five Virtues): They were formally enunciated in the Agreement on Trade between the Tibet region of China and India signed on April 29, 1954 and later evolved to act as the basis of conduct of international relations globally.\r\rThese Five Principles are:\r\rMutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty\rMutual non-aggression\rMutual non-interference\rEquality and mutual benefit\rPeaceful co-existence\r\r\r\r\rVasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The World is One Family): It is based on the concept of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas.\r\rIn other words, India views the entire world community as a single large global family, where members live in harmony, work and grow together, and have trust in one another.\r\r\rProactive and Impartial Assistance: India does not hesitate in promoting democracy wherever potential exists.\r\rThis is done by proactively providing assistance in capacity building and strengthening the institutions of democracy, albeit with the explicit consent of the concerned Government. (Ex. Afghanistan).\r\r\rGlobal Problem Solving Approach: India advocates a global debate and global consensus on issues of global dimensions such as world trade regime, climate change, terrorism, intellectual property rights, global governance, health hazards.\r\rUnder the Vaccine diplomacy initiative, India exported 60 million doses, half on commercial terms and 10 million as grants.'],
   'What are the Current Challenges to India’s Foreign Policy?': ['Russia Ukraine Issue: It is certainly a complex international political issue when countries like India find it difficult to choose between politics and moral imperative.\r\rRussia is a trade partner, and it has leverage in the Eurasian region, and by going directly against Russia, India will jeopardise its interests in the region.\r\rAs realist prudence demands, India cannot simply undertake a moralist standpoint on Russia-Ukraine Conflict and ignore the dictates of politics.\r\r\r\r\rInternal Challenges: A country cannot be powerful abroad if it is weak at home.\r\rIndia’s soft power assets make sense when they are supported by its hard power.\r\rFormer President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam repeatedly made the case that India can play an effective role on the world stage when it is strong internally as well as externally.\r\r\r\r\rRefugee Crisis: In spite of not being a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, India has been one of the largest recipients of refugees in the world.\r\rThe challenge here is to balance protection of human rights and national interest. As the Rohingya crisis unfolds, there is still a lot that India can do to facilitate the finding of long-term solutions.\rThese actions will be key in determining India’s regional and global standing on human rights.'],
   'What Should be the Way Forward?': ['Collective Approach to Tackle Environmental Issues: India has the potential to take the lead in tackling global environmental challenges reflected in its goal of reaching net zero by 2070 (26th United Nations Conference on Climate Change in 2021)\r\rEnvironmental problems are intertwined with social processes. There is a need for achieving sustainability at social, economic as well as ecological level as highlighted in Sustainable Developement Goals.\r\r\rBalancing Internal and External Development: India should look forward to creating an external environment which is conducive for an inclusive development of India so that the benefits of growth can reach the poorest of the poor in the country.\r\rAnd ensure that India’s voice is heard on global forums and that India is able to influence world opinion on issues of global dimensions such as terrorism, climate change, disarmament, reforms of institutions of global governance.\r\r\rPouring Ethical Values in Foreign Policy: As rightly said by Mahatma Gandhi, politics without principles and ethics would be disastrous. India should move towards collective development with an ethical persuasion reclaiming its moral leadership in the world at large.\rPolicy Evolution Along with Maintaining Basic Principles: We are living in a dynamic world. India’s foreign policy is therefore geared up to be proactive, flexible as well as pragmatic so as to make quick adjustments to respond to evolving situations.\r\rIn the implementation of its foreign policy India, however, invariably adheres to a set of basic principles on which no compromise is made securing:\r\rNational Beliefs & Values\rNational Interests\rNational Strategy\r\r\r\r\rShaping the Global Agenda: It is important for India to trace the role of a “leading power" in the international system, one that shapes global norms and institutional architecture, rather than these being shaped by others.\r\rTo this is linked the aspiration to be a Permanent Member of the expanded UN Security Council for which a large number of countries have already pledged support.\r\r\rDiplomacy for Development: In order to sustain its growth trajectory, India needs substantial external inputs.\r\rTo succeed, our on-going programmes such as Make in India, Skill India, Smart Cities, infrastructure development, Digital India, Clean India etc. need foreign partners , Foreign Direct Investments, financial assistance and transfer of technology.\r\rIndia’s foreign policy should add focus on this aspect of Diplomacy For Development by integrating economic diplomacy with political diplomacy.'],

  'data': {'Mental health awareness: The importance of conversation': ['By Allaya Cooks-Campbell January 19, 2022- 12 min read Share this article'],
   'What is mental health awareness?': ['So what does mental health awareness mean, and how do you promote it?'],
   'How can mental health awareness help?': ['Mental health awareness is critical to promoting mental health treatment and behavioral health.\xa0It’s a necessary and foundational conversation for changing to a more proactive model of mental health. Right now, we only fill our tanks when they’re on “empty.” Developing our awareness helps us start to recognize the signs and symptoms when we’re feeling “off” — just as we do with physical illness.'],
   '1. Helps you understand your symptoms': ['Sometimes, there is magic in having a diagnosis. Despite the stigma around the term, it’s simply a shorthand for a collection of symptoms that occur together. Especially with mental health conditions, which are difficult to pinpoint — and sometimes impossible to find — on a test, a diagnosis can be incredibly validating. It can help people feel less alone and make it easier to find treatment. Pay attention to your symptoms. For example, you might feel like your mental health worsens with social media use.'],
   '2. Starts a conversation': ["Mental health awareness is an ongoing conversation, but up until recently, it's only been had in whispers. But because a common feature of many moods and anxiety disorders is distorted thinking, talking about it can actually be immensely therapeutic."],
   '3. Better education': ["It's crucial for caregivers, employers, parents, family members, and loved ones to understand the impact that mental health has on daily life. However, while mental health conditions can make daily life more difficult, they also don't have to prevent you from having a fulfilling and engaging life. When the people in your life understand and prioritize mental health care, it makes it easier to take the actions you need to do to take care of yourself and thrive."],
   '4. Promotes mental fitness': ["Many of us have fallen into the trap of thinking of mental health as solely related to mental illness. However, it's possible to have a mental health condition and be mentally fit, and the absence of a mental health condition doesn't necessarily ensure mental fitness. Expanding our understanding of mental health issues and wellness to incorporate mental fitness, a proactive approach to emotional health, well-being, and cognitive agility. It allows us to live life with more purpose, clarity, and passion. Reducing the stigma around mental health is an important step to embracing mental fitness."],
   '3 tips to promote mental health awareness': ['How can individual people, especially non-clinicians, make a difference in promoting mental health awareness? A big part of it is learning to talk and share about mental health openly. When we are quiet about mental health and fitness, we allow stigma to continue. That silence makes it harder for people to prioritize their own mental well-being.'],
   'Speak up for yourself': ["How often do you see someone take a mental health day? And how often do you see them being honest about it? Many of us feel like our physical well-being is more important than our mental well-being. We take a day off when we're sick, but not when we're feeling emotionally drained or exhausted. The next time you take time off, be honest with your team that you're taking the time for your mental well-being. When you participate in self-advocacy for your mental health, you're empowering others to do the same. You'll likely inspire others to do the same."],
   'Learn more about mental health': ["Take the time to learn about mental health and mental fitness. But beyond that, learn how to differentiate the two. Learn about common mental health conditions, signs of burnout, and how to take care of yourself when you're experiencing symptoms. It can be helpful to keep an eye on your own warning signs to know when you're starting to get triggered or overwhelmed. If you find resources that may benefit others, share them with those around you."],
   'Talk to a coach': ["One of my favorite things about working for BetterUp is that every person here has a coach. Whether I'm talking to a manager, a colleague, someone in another department, or an executive, it's common for us to share stories or insights from our coaching sessions. At BetterUp, we truly have a culture of personal development and mental fitness. It's perfectly acceptable to take time for the Inner Work® that makes our outer work sustainable and more successful."],
   'Why is mental health awareness so important?': ["Mental health isn't just a conversation for people dealing with mental health disorders. It impacts our social, emotional, physical, and cognitive well-being."],
   'Additional mental health resources': ['You don’t have to do it alone. Organizations and resources are here (and waiting) to help. Lean on the mental health providers below for support — or pass them along to a loved one who might be struggling.'],
