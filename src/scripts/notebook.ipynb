The authors wish to thank Alex Dichter and Vik Krishnan for their contributions to this article.This article was edited by Jason Li, a senior editor in the Shanghai office.'],\n",
       " '1. Leisure trips will fuel the recovery': ['Business travel will take longer to recover, and even then, we estimate it will only likely recover to around 80 percent of prepandemic levels by 2024. Remote work\\xa0and other flexible working arrangements are likely to remain in some form postpandemic and people will take fewer corporate trips.'],\n",
       " 'Watch': [\"A McKinsey Live event on 'Returning to corporate travel: How do we get it right?'\"],\n",
       " 'The call: Revisit flight economics': ['Airlines should reevaluate the economics of their operations, especially long-haul flights. First, a smaller contribution from business traffic could necessitate a different pricing logic. For example, today most carriers price point-to-point nonstop flights at a premium. Travelers who value time over price—mostly business travelers—book these nonstop flights. Leisure travelers, even those traveling in premium classes, are more price sensitive and may choose an indirect routing. This large gap between nonstop pricing and connect pricing may need to narrow.'],\n",
       " '2. Staggering debt levels will lead to ticket price increases and a larger role for government in the sector': ['Many airlines have had to borrow huge sums of money to stay afloat and cope with high daily cash burn rates. Tapping into state-provided aid, credit lines, and bond issuances, the industry collectively amassed more than $180 billion worth of debt in 2020,1“COVID-19 lowers airline credit ratings and raises the cost of debt,” International Air Transport Association, August 21, 2020, iata.org. a figure equivalent to more than half of total annual revenues that year. And debt levels are still rising (Exhibit 2). Repaying these loans is made even harder by worsening credit ratings and higher financing costs.'],\n",
       " 'The call: Be a constructive collaborator': ['As the state becomes a more active player—whether as a creditor, a direct shareholder, or as part of the board—airlines will find themselves having to deal more closely with the authorities. Instead of seeing this as a necessary restriction to access much-needed funds, airlines can treat it as an opportunity to shape how the sector evolves with a key stakeholder.'],\n",
       " '3. We will see a greater disparity of performance among airlines in the future': ['Some airlines have responded to the pandemic by restructuring for greater efficiency; others are merely muddling through. Occasionally, this is linked to state-aid programs, which may reduce the incentive for much-needed measures such as cost, organizational, and operational restructuring. Airlines that are not proactively transforming risk failing to set the business up for longer-term structural value creation.'],\n",
       " 'The call: Aim higher when it comes to IT and digital investment': ['Becoming better can necessitate investment. Even though many airlines find themselves in financial straits, we recommend investing more in IT and digitalization, not less. Before the pandemic, airlines spent roughly 5 percent of their revenue on IT. This is relatively low compared with other sectors. By means of comparison, the retail industry spends around 6 percent on average, and financial services 10 percent.'],\n",
       " '4. Aircraft markets may be oversupplied for some time to come': ['In the years before COVID-19, aircraft OEMs ramped up production in the anticipation of continued growth. This has led to a glut in aircraft availability. Furthermore, some carriers have returned relatively new aircraft to lessors, such as Norwegian Air Shuttle when it exited the long-haul market. Prices for used-aircraft leases have plummeted and are likely to remain lower. For instance, the monthly lease rate of a 2016 vintage Boeing 777-300ER aircraft was around $1.2 million in 2019. In 2020, the rate fell to less than $800,000. New aircraft are rumored to be available at even deeper discounts.'],\n",
       " 'The call: Act countercyclically now, if you can': ['If finances permit, carriers can consider acting countercyclically: locking in orders for new aircraft or confirming operating leases now when demand is low. Aircraft are a significant expense for an airline, making up 10 to 15 percent of a carrier’s cost base. As lease rates and OEM pricing fluctuate with supply and demand levels, inking deals during a crisis could allow carriers to enjoy a cost advantage for years to come.'],\n",
       " '5. Air freight will see undersupply for some time': ['Over the past ten years, low cargo rates and the unprofitability of the cargo business have led many airlines to relinquish or scale back their dedicated cargo freighter fleets. However, cargo has been a lifeline for the aviation industry during COVID-19. Before the pandemic, cargo typically made up around 12 percent of the sector’s total revenue; that percentage tripled last year. Based on data from the Airline Analyst, only 21 (down from 77 in 2019) of the airlines around the world that disclosed their operating performance achieved positive operating profits for the third quarter of 2020, traditionally the industry’s most profitable quarter. Among these 21 airlines, cargo revenue accounted for 49 percent of total revenues on average.'],\n",
       " 'The call: Bring back freighters, carefully': ['In response to the high demand and low supply of air freight right now, carriers could investigate short- to medium-term opportunities to boost their cargo services. Airlines can enhance their flexibility through measures such as increasing the deployment of so-called preighters, or passenger airplanes that are used to transport cargo. Airlines may look at freighter conversions, especially as their passenger fleets reduce in number.'],\n",

      "{'url': 'https://www.sankalpindia.net/history-indian-space-research', 'data': \"India's experience in rocketry began in ancient times when fireworks were first used in the country, a technology invented in neighbouring China, and which had an extensive two-way exchange of ideas and goods with India, connected by the Silk Road. Military use of rockets by Tipu Sultan during the Mysore War against the British inspired William Congreve to invent the Congreve rocket, predecessor of modern artillery rockets, in 1804. After India gained independence from British occupation in 1947, Indian scientists and politicians recognized the potential of rocket technology in both defence applications, and for research and development. Recognizing that a country as demographically large as India would require its own independent space capabilities, and recognising the early potential of satellites in the fields of remote sensing and communication, these visionaries set about establishing a space research organisation.\\n\\nDr. Vikram Sarabhai was the founding father of the Indian space program, and is considered a scientific visionary by many, as well as a national hero. After the launch of Sputnik in 1957 he recognized the potential that satellites provided. India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who saw scientific development as an essential part of India's future, placed space research under the jurisdiction of the Department of Atomic Energy in 1961. The DAE director Homi Bhabha, who was father of India's atomic programme, then established the Indian National Committee for Sapce Research (INCOSPAR) with Dr. Sarabhai as Chairman in 1962.\\n\\nThe Indian Rohini programme continued to launch sounding rockets of greater size and complexity, and the space programme was expanded and eventually given its own government department, separate from the Department of Atomic Energy. On August 15th 1969 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was created from the INCOSPAR programme under the DAE, continued under the Space Commission and finally the Department of Space, created in June of 1972.\\n\\nIn the 1960s Sarabhai had taken part in an early study with NASA regarding the feasibility of using satellites for applications as wide as direct television broadcasting, and this study had found that it was the most economical way of transmitting such broadcasts. Having recognized the benefits that the satellites could bring to India from the very start, Sarabhai and the ISRO set about designing and creating an independent launch vehicle, capable of launching into orbit, and providing the valuable experience needed for the construction of larger launch vehicles in future. Recognizing the advanced capability India had in building solid motors with the Rohini series, and that other nations had favoured solid rockets for similar projects, the ISRO set about building the technology and infrastructure for the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV). Inspired by the American Scout rocket, the vehicle would be a four-stage all-solid vehicle.\\n\\nAryabhata - India's first satellite\\n\\nMeanwhile, India began developing satellite technology anticipating the remote sensing and communication needs of the future. India concentrated more on practical missions, directly beneficial to people instead of manned space programs or robotic space explorations. The Aryabhata satellite, launched in 1975 from Kapustin Yar using a Soviet Cosmos-3M launch vehicle, was India's first satellite.\\n\\nSLV - India's first satellite launch vehicle\\n\\nBy 1979 the SLV was ready to be launched from a newly-established second launch site, the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC). The first launch in 1979 was a failure, attributed to a control failure in the second stage. By 1980 this problem had been worked out. The first indigenous satellite launched by India was called Rohini-1.\\n\\nFollowing the success of the SLV, ISRO was keen to begin construction of a satellite launch vehicle that would be able to put truly useful satellites into polar orbits. Design of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) was soon underway. This vehicle would be designed as India's workhorse launch system, taking advantage of both old technology with large reliable solid-stages, and new liquid engines. At the same time, it was decided by the ISRO management that it would be prudent to develop a smaller rocket, based on the SLV, that would serve as a testbed for many of the new technologies that would be used on the PSLV. The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) would test technologies like strap-on boosters and new guidance systems, so that experience could be gained before the PSLV went into full production.\\n\\nEventually, the ASLV was flight tested in 1987, but this launch was a failure. After minor corrections, another launch was attempted in 1988, this launch again failed, and this time a full investigation was launched into the cause, providing valuable experience, specifically because the ASLV's failure had been one of control - the vehicle could not be adequately controlled on removal of the stabilizing fins that were present on the SLV, so extra measures like improved maneuvering thrusters and flight control system upgrades were added. The ASLV development had also proven useful in the development of strap-on motor technology.\\n\\nIt was not until 1992 that the first successful launch of the ASLV took place. At this point the launch vehicle, which could only put very small payloads into orbit, had achieved its objective. In 1993 the time had come for the maiden flight of the PSLV. The first launch was a failure. The first successful launch took place in 1994, and since then, the PSLV has become the workhorse launch vehicle - placing both remote sensing and communications satellites into orbit, creating the largest cluster in the world, and providing unique data to Indian industry and agriculture. Continual performance upgrades have increased the payload capacity of the rocket significantly since then.\\n\\nUnder pressure, Glavkosmos halted the transfer of the associated manufacturing and design technology to India. Until then, ISRO had not been affected by technology transfer restrictions thanks to the political foresight of Sarabhai in indigenizing technology. However, elements of the ISRO management cancelled indigenous cryogenic projects in anticipation of the Russian deal. Instead of canceling the deal, Russia agreed to provide fully built engines instead, and India began developing an indigenous cryogenic engine to replace them, in the GSLV-II. There is still some controversy over the issue of the cryogenic engine acquisition, with many pointing to the decision to cancel indigenous projects as being a grave mistake - India would have likely had a fully indigenous engine operating by the time the GSLV launched if indigenous development had started from day one. Despite this one uncharacteristic slip in an otherwise extremely successful programme, and the loss of potential payload capacity over the decade that occurred as a result, ISRO pressed on.\\n\\nCurrently the most powerful Indian launch vehicle in operation; the first development flight of the GSLV took place in 2001. The program’s benefits have been scrutinized due to frequent payload cutbacks and delays. The indigenous cryogenic engine for the GSLV's upper stage was tested in 2007. ISRO has reconsidered the effectiveness of the GSLV for the needs of the 2000-2010 decade and began development of an indigenous and new heavy launch vehicle, GSLV III. The latter is not related to the GSLV-I/II and will be based around the proven format of liquid main stages and two solid strap-on boosters. It will resemble the Ariane 5 and other modern launchers and will have sufficient payload capacity for manned spaceflight. The inaugural flight is scheduled for 2008.\\n\\nChandrayaan 2008: ISRO intends to send a small robotic spacecraft into lunar orbit mounted on a modified PSLV. It will survey the surface of the moon in greater detail than ever before and attempt to locate resources. Countries, including the US have expressed interest in attaching their own payloads to the mission. ISRO and NASA have an agreement to carry two NASA probes as a payload.\\n\\nAVATAR Scramjet: This is a long-term project to develop a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) restricted to the launch of satellites. Theoretically, AVATAR would be a cost effective launch vehicle for small satellites and therefore a commercially competitive launch system. A scaled-down technology demonstrator is scheduled to fly c.2008. Recently ISRO successfully tested a scramjet air breathing engine which produced Mach 6 for seven seconds. ISRO will continue research related to using scramjets in RLVs after 2010.\\n\\nISRO has entered the lucrative market of launching payloads of other nations. Prominent among them are the launches of Israel Space Agency’s, TecSAR spy satellite, and Israeli Tauvex-II satellite module. The CARTOSAT-2, launched on the July 2006, carried a small Indonesian payload of 56 kg.\\n\\nLeveraging its expertise in cryogenic technology to design Hydrogen fuel cells to store and handling of hydrogen; ISRO teamed up with Tata motors to develop a prototype hydrogen passenger car for Indian market, expected to hit road by end of 2008.\\n\\nOn November 15, 2007 ISRO achieved a significant milestone through the successful test of indigenously developed Cryogenic Stage, to be employed as the upper stage of India's Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). The test was conducted for its full flight duration of 720 seconds on November 15, 2007 at Liquid Propulsion test facility at Mahendragiri, in Tamil Nadu. With this test, the indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage has been fully qualified on the ground. The flight stage is getting ready for use in the next mission of GSLV (GSLV-D3) in 2008.\\n\\nOn April 28, 2008 ISRO successfully launched 10 satellites in a single mission further boosting it's capabilities in space.\\n\\nThis includes 690 kg CARTOSTAT-2 and another 83 kg mini Indian satellite, IMS-1; and eight other nano satellites made by various universities; and research and development institutions in Canada and Germany offered at a subsidized price as part of a goodwill gesture by the Indian Department of Space.\"}\n",

NASA\\n\\nApollo 13 was headed for the moon. On April 11, 1970, the spacecraft lifted off. Fifty-five hours and 55 minutes later, an explosion shut down almost every system necessary to sustain life onboard.\\n\\nThe string of events leading to the explosion began in 1965, with an oversight involving the oxygen tank thermostats. Tank No. 2 — which had been damaged before the launch — violently ruptured when a fan was turned on. That set the stage for one of the most amazing collaborative rescues in history. So many things went wrong on Apollo 13, it\\'s an engineering miracle that the crew — astronauts James Lovell, John Swigert and Fred Hayes — made it home at all, let alone alive and well [source: Banke].\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMinutes after the crew completed a television broadcast from space, telling America everything was going well, an explosion shook the spacecraft. One disaster led to another. When Tank No. 2 blew up, the force caused another oxygen tank to malfunction. Immediately after, two of the craft\\'s three fuel cells shut down. Apollo 13 was 200,000 miles (321,868 kilometers) away from home, venting oxygen into space, and its normal supply of electric power, water, oxygen, heat and light had been cut off.\\n\\nThe ingenuity that followed is a testament to the genius of the human mind and spirit. To conserve whatever power, food, water and oxygen was left, the astronauts aboard Apollo 13 survived on almost no food, water and sleep and in temperatures that dropped to near freezing. The crew members lost a combined 31.5 pounds (14.3 kilograms) in less than six days.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the people on duty at NASA\\'s Mission Control center from April 11 through April 17 found a way to get the men home. They did months of calculation in days. They found a way to get the lunar module to support the crew and get the spacecraft back to Earth, although it was never intended for that purpose. The canisters that removed carbon dioxide from the command module didn\\'t fit the system in the lunar module. So Mission Control found a way for the astronauts to make them fit using tools they had onboard: cardboard, plastic bags and tape.\\n\\nStill, with no controls, no extended life support and no navigation system, the biggest problem of all was how to get the craft into a trajectory for an Earth landing. Apollo 13 had already made the planned adjustments for a moon landing before the initial explosion.\\n\\nMission control developed a plan. The onboard navigation was based on finding a key star. That system was out. In three hours, NASA found a way to use the sun instead, a series of calculations that would normally take three months; and they found a way to use the moon\\'s pull to get the craft into the right position, because they had to save all of the power for the trip home.\\n\\nThe calculations based on the sun turned out to be accurate to within less than 1 degree. Apollo 13 rounded the moon and descended toward Earth. So much condensation had built up on the walls of the lunar module from the days of cold that when the spacecraft finally powered up -- and heated up -- for the trip home, it rained inside the cabin [source: NASA].\\n\\nApollo 13 landed successfully on April 17, 1970, in the Pacific Ocean. While all of the astronauts were fine, the spacecraft, of course, was not. But that was typical for the time. NASA didn\\'t have a working reusable spacecraft until 1981, when the first space shuttle, named Columbia, made history.'}\n",

Moreover, in Antiquity, warring states observed a truce throughout the sporting competitions – a tradition that continues today, with the United Nations General Assembly adopting the Olympic Truce ahead of each edition of the Games. The history of the Games is incredibly rich and spans millennia.\\n\\nThe first written evidence of the official Games dates from 776 BC, when the Greeks began measuring time in Olympiads, or the duration between each edition of the Olympic Games. The first Olympic Games were held every four years in honour of the god Zeus. From then on, a number of artistic activities such as music, singing, poetry and theatre were organised at the Pythian or Delphic Games (a separate event to the Games held in Olympia), linking culture and sport right from the beginning of the Games.\\n\\nIn 393 AD, the Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned the Olympic Games for religious reasons, claiming that they encouraged paganism. They were not revived until the modern era\\n\\nA revival in Paris\\n\\nA number of initiatives to re-establish an international sporting event were attempted at the end of the 19th century, but failed due to the lack of coordination among the worldwide sporting movement – until one man decided to bring the main stakeholders together in Paris. The Olympic Games were therefore revived at the first Olympic Congress, organised by Baron Pierre de Coubertin and held at the Grand Amphitheatre at the Sorbonne University from 16 to 23 June 1894. Two thousand people attended, including 58 French delegates representing 24 sports organisations and clubs, and 20 delegates from Belgium, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the United States representing 13 foreign sports federations.\\n\\nAs the congress came to an end on 23 June, the Olympic Games were reborn and the International Olympic Committee created. The principles that guided Baron Pierre de Coubertin in this endeavour and inspired Olympism and the Olympic movement include :\\n\\nPromoting the development of the physical and mental qualities that form the foundation of sport;\\n\\nEducating young people through sport in a spirit of mutual understanding and friendship with a view to help build a better, more peaceful world;\\n\\nSharing the Olympic ideals with the whole world and creating an international sense of goodwill; and\\n\\nBringing together athletes from all over the world for a major celebration of sport every four years, the Olympic Games.\\n\\nWomen finally allowed to take part\\n\\nThe first Olympic Games of the modern era took place in Athens, in the country where the original Games took place in Antiquity, in April 1896. Paris hosted the second Games in 1900.\\n\\nThe Paris 1900 Olympic Games saw women compete for the first time. The first female Olympic champion was Charlotte Cooper, a British tennis player who won Wimbledon five times. Out of a total of 997 athletes, 22 were women, competing in just five sports: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian events and golf. Of these disciplines, only golf and tennis included women‑only events. According to the Olympic Charter, the IOC’s role is “to encourage and support the promotion of women in sport at all levels and in all structures, with a view to implementing the principle of equality of men and women”. Female participation in the Olympic Games has increased dramatically since; 48.9% of the athletes at the 2020 Tokyo Games are expected to be women, as opposed to 23% at the 1984 Los Angeles Games and just 13% at the 1964 Tokyo Games. The IOC has been working with international federations as well as the Olympic Games Organising Committees to increase the number of women’s events at the Games for over 20 years. By adding a women’s boxing event, the Games in London in 2012 were the first where women competed in all sports of the Olympic programme. At the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016, 45% (5,059 women out of a total of 11,238) of the athletes were women. The Games of Tokyo in 2021 were the most equal yet, with 48.9% women athletes.\\n\\nThe development of the Games over the centuries\\n\\nThe 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis (Missouri) were the first to distribute gold, silver and bronze medals, and also included the first known disabled athlete to compete in the Olympic Games, George Eyser. He won six medals in gymnastics, three of which were gold.\\n\\nThe Olympic Games in Stockholm in 1912 were the first to include competitors from all five continents represented by the Olympic rings. It was also the year that women made their debut in the swimming events.\\n\\nFrom 1912 to 1948, artistic competitions were part of the modern Olympic Games, on the initiative of Pierre de Coubertin. Medals were awarded for sport‑related artwork falling in five categories: architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture. In 1920, the Games continued after having been cancelled in 1916 due to World War I. The Olympic flag and the Olympic Oath, written by Pierre de Coubertin, were revealed at the Games in Antwerp.\\n\\n“We swear that we will take part in the Olympic Games in a spirit of chivalry, for the honour of our country and for the glory of sport.”\\n\\n1924\\n\\nThe Olympic Games were held for the second and third times in France – in Chamonix from January to February for the first ever Winter Olympic Games, then in Paris again in the summer. The Olympic motto of “citius, altius, fortius” (faster, higher, stronger), used by Pierre de Coubertin since 1896 and taken from the priest Henri Didon, was also highlighted that year.\\n\\nThe Paris Olympic Games of 1924 were the first to build an Olympic Village, which has become customary at every Games since.\\n\\ni The Colombes olympic Village, and services available for the athletes (official report of the VIIIth Olympiad). ×\\n\\n1932\\n\\nDuring the Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York, a woman acted as the flag‑bearer for an Olympic delegation for the first time; that woman was Mollie Phillips, a figure skater for Great Britain.\\n\\n1936\\n\\nThe Winter and Summer Olympic Games took place in Germany, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Berlin respectively. For the first time, the spectacle of the opening ceremony was broadcast live — an incredible development. Between big screens set up in Germany and the few households owning television sets, around 150,000 viewers tuned in. However, the Games served as a propaganda tool for Nazi Germany; the epitome of this was Leni Riefenstahl’s documentary film of the Games in Berlin, Olympia, which served as a monument to Nazism.\\n\\nIt was also at the Berlin Games in 1936 that the Olympic flame was introduced for the first time.\\n\\n1940-1944\\n\\nthe Olympic Games of the XII and XIII Olympiads were cancelled due to the ongoing World War II.\\n\\nThe Winter Olympic Games held at St Moritz in 1948 were therefore named “The Games of Renewal”.\\n\\n1952\\n\\nThe Winter Olympic Games in Oslo were declared open by a woman for the first time – Princess Ragnhild of Norway.\\n\\n1960\\n\\nThe ninth Stoke Mandeville Games were held in the same city as the Olympic Games, Rome, one week later. This event is considered to be the first ever Paralympic Games.\\n\\n1968\\n\\nThe Grenoble Olympic Games were broadcasted live and in colour on television for the first time.\\n\\ni General view of the Olympic Flame during the Opening Ceremony of the 1968 Winter Olympics ×\\n\\n1988\\n\\nSince the Games in Séoul, the Olympic and Paralympic Games have always taken place in the same city, separated by just a few weeks.\\n\\n1994\\n\\nThe Winter Games were held in Lillehammer , just two years after the last Winter Games in Albertville, in 1992. This adjustment was made so that the Winter Games would no longer be held in the same year as the Summer Olympics, which take place in the first year of each Olympiad.\\n\\n1996\\n\\nFor the first time in Olympic history, all 197 of the National Olympic Committees (NOC) were represented at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Of those NOCs, 79 won medals, with 53 taking gold.\\n\\nThat same year, Italian archer Paola Fantato became the first athlete to compete in the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the same year.\\n\\n2000\\n\\nAt the Olympic Games in Sydney, North and South Korea marched together under the same flag at the opening ceremony. This was an unprecedented symbol of peace since diplomatic relations between the two states had ended after the Korean War of 1950 to 1953.\\n\\n2003\\n\\nThe legacy concept was added to the document that sets out the rules for governing the Olympic movement, the Olympic Charter. This addition came about after a period of reflection in the 1990s, with the Games in Barcelona in 1992 serving as an example. The Olympic Games needed to be seen as more than just a periodic sport event, but also a way to bring about urban development and have a positive impact on the society where they take place. From now on, to be selected by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), applicant cities must have a long‑term plan.\\n\\n2004\\n\\nThe Iraqi football team stunned at the Games in Athens. Despite the war ravaging their country, the team reached the semi‑finals of the tournament, offering a brief distraction for Iraqis and the entire world from their country’s dramatic situation. That same year was the first time that the Olympic torch relay, after leaving Olympia, crossed every habitable continent before returning to Greece.\\n\\n2010\\n\\nThe first summer version of the Youth Olympic Games took place in 2010, with the first winter version taking place in 2012 — proof of the Olympic movement’s strong commitment to youth and education.\\n\\ni Opening ceremony of the 2012 Winter Youth Olympic Games in Innsbruck (Photo credit : IOC media). ×\\n\\n2014\\n\\nThe 127th Session of the IOC took place in Monaco on 8 December and approved to modify the Olympic Charter by adding: “any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement”.\\n\\nToday'}\n",

      "{'url': 'https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/key-components-civilization/', 'data': 'Civilization describes a complex way of life that came about as people began to develop networks of urban settlements. The earliest civilizations developed between 4000 and 3000 B.C.E., when the rise of agriculture and trade allowed people to have surplus food and economic stability. Many people no longer had to practice farming, allowing a diverse array of professions and interests to flourish in a relatively confined area. Civilizations first appeared in Mesopotamia (what is now Iraq) and later in Egypt. Civilizations thrived in the Indus Valley by about 2500 B.C.E., in China by about 1500 B.C.E. and in Central America (what is now Mexico) by about 1200 B.C.E. Civilizations ultimately developed on every continent except Antarctica.\\n\\nCharacteristics of Civilization\\n\\nAll civilizations have certain characteristics. These include: large population centers; monumental architecture and unique art styles; shared communication strategies; systems for administering territories; a complex division of labor; and the division of people into social and economic classes.\\n\\nUrban Areas\\n\\nLarge population centers, or urban areas, allow civilizations to develop, although people who live outside these urban centers are still part of that region’s civilization. Rural residents of civilizations may include farmers, fishers, and traders, who regularly sell their goods and services to urban residents. The huge urban center of Teotihuacan, in modern-day Mexico, for example, had as many as 200,000 residents between 300 and 600 C.E.\\n\\nThe development of the Teotihuacano civilization was made possible in part by the rich agricultural land surrounding the city. As land was cultivated, fewer farmers could supply more food staples, such as corn and beans, to more people. Trade also played a part in Teotihuacan’s urban development. Much of the wealth and power of Teotihuacan was due to excavating and trading the rich deposits of obsidian around the city. Obsidian is a hard volcanic rock that was highly valued as a cutting tool. Teotihuacano merchants traded (exported) obsidian to surrounding cultures in exchange for goods and services imported to Teotihuacano settlements.\\n\\nMonuments\\n\\nAll civilizations work to preserve their legacy by building large monuments and structures. This is as true today as it was thousands of years ago. For example, the ancient monuments at Great Zimbabwe are still consistently used as a symbol of political power in the modern nation of Zimbabwe. Great Zimbabwe, constructed between 1100 and 1450, describes the ruins of the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe. At its peak, Great Zimbabwe was inhabited by more than 10,000 people and was part of a trading network that extended from the Maghreb, through the eastern coast of Africa, and as far east as India and China.\\n\\nGreat Zimbabwe is a testament to the sophistication and ingenuity of ancestors of the local Shona people. Politicians like Robert Mugabe, the president who led Zimbabwe for nearly 40 years in the 20th and 21st centuries, built their entire political identities by associating themselves with the ancient civilization’s monumental architecture. Buildings are not the only monuments that define civilizations. The distinct artistic style of Great Zimbabwe included representations of native animals carved in soapstone. The stylized stone sculptures known as “Zimbabwe Birds”, for example, remain an emblem of Zimbabwe, appearing on the nation’s flag, currency, and coats of arms.\\n\\nShared Communication\\n\\nShared communication is another element that all civilizations share. Shared communication may include spoken language; alphabets; numeric systems; signs, ideas, and symbols; and illustration and representation. Shared communication allows the infrastructure necessary for technology, trade, cultural exchange, and government to be developed and shared throughout the civilization. The Inca civilization, for example, had no written script that we know of, but its complex khipu system of accounting allowed the government to conduct censuses of its population and production across the vast stretch of the Andes. A khipu is a recording device made of a series of strings knotted in particular patterns and colors.\\n\\nWritten language in particular allows civilizations to record their own history and everyday events—crucial for understanding ancient cultures. The world\\'s oldest known written language is Sumerian, which developed in Mesopotamia around 3100 B.C.E. The most familiar form of early Sumerian writing was called cuneiform, and was made up of different collections of wedge (triangle) shapes. The earliest Sumerian writing was record-keeping. Just like written records of modern civilizations, Sumerian cuneiform kept track of taxes, grocery bills, and laws for things like theft.\\n\\nWritten language was a key part of shared communication during the Islamic Golden Age, which flourished in southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia from the seventh to the 13th centuries. So-called “Arabic numerals” and the Arabic language were shared communications that allowed diverse cultures across the Arabic world to contribute the dazzling advances in mathematics, science, technology, and the arts.\\n\\nInfrastructure and Administration\\n\\nAll civilizations rely on government administration—bureaucracy. Perhaps no civilization better exemplifies this than ancient Rome. The word “civilization” itself comes from the Latin word civis\\ufeff, meaning \"citizen.\" Latin was the language of ancient Rome, whose territory stretched from the Mediterranean basin all the way to parts of Great Britain in the north and the Black Sea to the east. To rule an area that large, the Romans, based in what is now central Italy, needed an effective system of government administration and infrastructure. Romans used a variety of methods to administer their republic and, later, empire.\\n\\nEngineering, for instance, was a key part of Roman administration. Romans built a network of roads so that communication between far-away territories was as efficient as possible. Roads also made travel by the Roman military much easier. Romans built structures of their civilization everywhere they went: aqueducts supplied freshwater to towns for improved sanitation and hygiene, for example.\\n\\nLanguage also played a part in Roman infrastructure. Romans spread the Latin language throughout southern Europe. The so-called \"Romance languages\" (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Romanian, Catalan, and Italian) are called that because they all developed from the Roman language: Latin. Having a similar language made communication and leadership easier for Rome in its far-flung territories. Roman leaders relied on a series of legal codes for administration. These codes helped structure laws between different parts of Roman territory, as well as between rich and poor, men and women, slave and free. Roman laws included restrictions on marriage, ownership of land, and access to professions such as priesthoods.\\n\\nOne of Rome’s most lasting contributions to Western Civilization was the establishment of legal culture itself. Roman law was largely public, and jurists created such formalities as legal language and procedure that would define European law for centuries. In fact, “Roman law” describes the legal system used throughout Western Europe through the 18th century.\\n\\nFinally, Romans used local leaders, as well as Romans, to administer the law in their territories. Residents were more familiar with their own leaders, and more likely to follow their announcements. Israeli leaders worked with Roman authorities in the Roman territory of Palestine, for example, while British leaders often worked with Romans on the island of Great Britain. Some people born in Roman territories eventually became Roman emperors: The emperor Constantine, for instance, was born in what is now Serbia; the emperor Hadrian may have been born in what is now Spain. This interaction reduced conflict between Rome and its territories.\\n\\nDivision of Labor\\n\\nCivilizations are marked by complex divisions of labor. This means that different people perform specialized tasks. In a purely agricultural society, members of the community are largely self-sufficient, and can provide food, shelter, and clothing for themselves. In a complex civilization, farmers may cultivate one type of crop and depend on other people for other foods, clothing, shelter, and information. Civilizations that depend on trade are specially marked by divisions of labor.\\n\\nThe city of Timbuktu, in what is now Mali, was an important trading center for several African civilizations. Residents of Timbuktu specialized in trading such goods as gold, ivory, or enslaved people. Other residents provided food or shelter for trade caravans traveling on camels from the Sahara. The urban center of Timbuktu was also a center of learning. Its division of labor included not only merchants, but doctors, religious leaders, and artists.\\n\\nClass Structure\\n\\nThe last element that is key to the development of civilizations is the division of people into classes. This is a complex idea that can be broken down into two parts: income and type of work performed. Changing classes has traditionally been difficult and happens over generations. Classes can mean groups of people divided by their income. This division is sometimes characterized as “economic class.” Modern Western Civilization often divides economic classes into wealthy, middle-class, and poor. In medieval civilizations of Europe, there were fewer economic classes. Kings and queens had enormous amounts of money and land. Serfs, or people who worked the land, had almost nothing. Eventually, a merchant economic class developed.\\n\\nClass can also refer to the type of work people perform. There are many divisions of social class. Social class is often associated with economic class, but not strictly defined by it. In the ancient civilization of China, there were four major types of social classes. Scholars and political leaders (known as shi) were the most powerful social class. Farmers and agricultural workers (nong) were the next most-powerful group. Artists (gong), who made everything from horseshoes to silk robes, were the next order of social class. At the bottom of the social classes were the merchants and traders, who bought and sold goods and services. Known as shang\\ufeff, these merchants were often much wealthier than the other classes but had a lower social status.\\n\\nDevelopment of Civilization\\n\\nCivilizations expand through trade, conflict, and exploration. Usually, all three elements must be present for a civilization to grow and remain stable for a long period of time. The physical and human geography of Southeast Asia allowed these attributes to develop in the Khmer civilization. The Khmer flourished in parts of what are now Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar between 800 and 1400.\\n\\nTrade\\n\\nThe Khmer maintained vibrant trading relationships throughout East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and even Europe and Africa through the Silk Road, a collection of both overland and maritime trade routes. The Silk Road linked the spice and silk markets of Asia with the merchants of Europe. Southeast Asia’s extensive network of waterways facilitated trade, with the Khmer capital of Angkor being built on the shores of Southeast Asia’s largest freshwater lake, Tonle Sap. The outflowing Tonle Sap River is a tributary of the mighty Mekong River, which connects Southeast Asia with the Tibetan Plateau in the north and the South China Sea in the south. In addition to material goods, the Khmer civilization facilitated a powerful trade in ideas. In particular, the Khmer were instrumental in spreading the influence of Buddhist and Hindu cultures from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia.\\n\\nConflict\\n\\nThe primary conflicts of the Khmer civilization were waged with neighboring communities—the Cham, the Vietnamese, and the Thai. The Cham were a collection of kingdoms in what is today central and southern Vietnam, while the ancient Vietnamese influence extended through what is today northern Vietnam. Thai kingdoms such as Sukothai and Ayutthaya flourished in what are now Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia. The Khmer civilization was founded on the consistent resistance of political pressure from the Cham and Vietnamese, but it ultimately could not withstand pressure from Thai civilizations. Thousands of Thai peoples migrated from the north (what is now the Yunnan region of China), establishing small kingdoms in the southwest of the Khmer Empire. Eventually, these kingdoms became strong enough to annex Khmer territory, leading to Ayutthaya’s conquest of the Khmer capital of Angkor in 1431.\\n\\nExploration and Innovation\\n\\nThe Khmer civilization relied heavily on rice farming, and developed a complex irrigation system to take advantage of the rivers and wetlands that dotted their territory. An efficient series of irrigation canals and reservoirs, called barays, allowed fewer farmers to produce more rice. This, in turn, allowed more people to pursue nonagricultural lifestyles and migrate to great urban areas, such as Angkor. Angkor, the capital of the ancient Khmer civilization, is home to one of the largest most distinctive religious monuments in the world, Angkor Wat.\\n\\nAngkor Wat was originally constructed as a series of shrines to the Hindu god Vishnu in the early 12th century, although it became a Buddhist temple complex less than a hundred years later. Angkor Wat and its sister complex, Angkor Thom, are beautiful examples of classic Khmer architecture. The towering, stepped pyramid towers of Angkor Wat are called “temple mountains.” The towers are surrounded by open gallery walkways, and the entire structure is enclosed by a wall and square moat. The thousands of square meters of wall space at Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom are decorated by thousands of bas-reliefs and sculptures depicting Hindu stories and characters. The Khmer monument at Angkor Wat helps define the modern nation of Cambodia today. It is the nation’s primary tourist attraction, a World Heritage Site, and even appears on the Cambodian flag.\\n\\nFall of Civilizations\\n\\nMany civilizations have flourished and then failed or fell apart. There are many reasons for this, but many historians point to three patterns in the fall of civilizations: internal change, external pressure, and environmental collapse. The fall of civilizations is never the result of a single event or pattern. Sometimes, civilizations seem to “disappear” entirely.\\n\\nInternal Change\\n\\nPopulation dynamics are the most pervasive forces of internal change to a civilization. A sudden population shift or a shift in demographics may force a civilization’s infrastructure to break down. Populations may grow, due to migration or a period of unusual health. Populations may shrink, due to disease, extreme weather, or other environmental factors. Finally, populations may redefine themselves. As civilizations grow, cities may grow larger and become more culturally distinct from rural, agricultural areas. Large empires may extend across such large regions that languages, cultures, and customs may dilute the identity of the empire’s residents.\\n\\nInternal changes contributed to the collapse of the Maya civilization, which had thrived in Mesoamerica for more than a thousand years. The “Classic Maya” collapse happened relatively quickly in the 800s. Diseases such as dysentery and lethal hemorrhagic fevers killed and disabled thousands of Mayans. Millions more were forced to relocate from cities to more rural areas. Such huge population shifts reduced the ability of the Maya to communicate, administrate, and unite against outside forces and natural disasters (such as drought).\\n\\nExternal Pressure\\n\\nThe clearest example of external pressure on a civilization is foreign invasion or sustained warfare. Protecting a civilization’s borders can be extremely expensive and demand a strong military at the expense of developing or maintaining other aspects of a civilization. External pressure can lead to the relatively abrupt end of a civilization (and, often, the adoption of another). The fall of the Aztec Empire with the arrival of European conquistadores is such an example.\\n\\nExternal pressures can also lead to the gradual diminishing of a civilization. The “fall” of what we often think of as Ancient Egypt is a good example of how external pressures can redefine a civilization over hundreds of years. Egypt had faced longstanding, intermittent conflict on its borders, with competing civilizations such as the Nubians (to the south), the Assyrians (in the Middle East), and the Libyans (to the west). Later, Egypt encountered the civilizations of Ancient Greece and Rome, and eventually became part of the Roman Empire. Ancient Egypt also faced external pressures not directly associated with armed conflict. The powerful forces of Christianity and Islam influenced the eradication of both hieroglyphics, the writing system of Ancient Egypt, and its polytheistic religion.\\n\\nEnvironmental Collapse\\n\\nSome anthropologists think that both natural disasters and misuse of the environment contributed to the decline of many civilizations. Natural hazards such as drought, floods, and tsunamis, become natural disasters as they impact civilizations. Drought contributed to the fall of civilizations such as the Maya and the Indus Valley or Harappan civilization.\\n\\nThe Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in what is now Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan. The Indus Valley Civilization depended on seasonal monsoon rains to supply water for drinking, hygiene, and irrigation. Climate change made monsoons much more unpredictable and seasonal flooding less reliable. Harappans suffered from water-borne diseases and were unable to effectively irrigate their crops. The collapse of Minoan civilization, a major influence on Ancient Greece, is often associated with a catastrophic eruption of the Thera volcano on the island of what is now Santorini. The eruption caused a massive tsunami that reduced the population, trading capabilities, and influence of the Minoans.\\n\\nHuman activity can also strain the environment to the point of a civilization’s collapse. One of several factors contributing to the collapse of the Viking outpost in Greenland, for instance, was the failure of European settlers to adapt to Greenland’s climate and soil. Farming methods that were successful in the rich, loamy soils of Northern Europe were ill-suited to Greenland’s colder, thinner soil and shorter growing seasons. The land could not support the crops necessary to sustain Viking livestock, including goats, cattle, and sheep. In addition, the land itself was harvested for peat, the outpost’s primary construction material. The Vikings in Greenland also faced internal pressures, such as a weak trading system with Europe, and external pressures, such as a hostile relationship with their Inuit neighbors.\\n\\n‘Lost Civilizations’\\n\\nHistory and myth are rich with “lost civilizations,” entire ways of life that seemed to flourish and then disappear from the historical record. The disappearance of the Ancestral Puebloan civilization is one such mystery. Ancestral Puebloan civilization thrived in what is now the Four Corners region of the United States: the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.\\n\\nAncestral Puebloan civilization developed around 1200 B.C.E. and thrived for more than a thousand years. Ancestral Puebloan civilization was marked by monumental architecture in the form of apartment-like cliff dwellings and large urban areas known as pueblos. Culturally diverse Ancestral Puebloans were connected by a complex road system, a standard style of religious worship, and a unique art style evidenced by pottery and petroglyphs.\\n\\nAncestral Puebloans seem to have abandoned their urban areas around 1300 C.E. The disappearance of this civilization remains a mystery, although most scientists say Ancestral Puebloans engaged in warfare with their Navajo neighbors, internal groups competed for land and resources, and sustained droughts reduced Ancestral Puebloan ability to irrigate crops in the arid Southwest. The Pueblo people never disappeared, of course: Diverse groups developed their own, competing civilizations after the Ancestral Puebloans migrated or fell apart. These groups include the Zuni and Hopi civilizations.'}\n",

The country has witnessed an incredible transformation in the last few decades, and it is all thanks to the efforts of the government, businesses, and people. The digital revolution in India has created an ecosystem that is transforming the country, driving growth and innovation in all sectors. In this article, we will delve into the reasons why India has become a global leader in the digital revolution and how it is impacting the country.\\n\\nOverview of the Digital Revolution in India\\n\\nThe digital revolution in India started in the 1990s, with the advent of computers and the internet. However, it was not until the early 2000s that the digital revolution really took off in the country. This was when the government started to focus on building a robust IT infrastructure, and businesses began to leverage technology to enhance their operations. Today, India is home to some of the world’s leading technology companies, and the country has emerged as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.\\n\\nOne of the significant drivers of the digital revolution in India has been the government’s focus on technology. The government has launched several initiatives to promote digitalization in the country, including the Digital India program. The program aims to create a digital infrastructure that will enable every citizen to access government services and information online. Additionally, the government has launched several schemes to promote digital literacy, such as the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA), which aims to make one person in every rural household digitally literate.\\n\\nAnother critical driver of the digital revolution in India has been the rise of startups. India is home to some of the world’s most successful startups, such as Flipkart, Paytm, and Ola. These companies have leveraged technology to disrupt traditional industries and create new markets. They have also created a startup ecosystem that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship. The government has launched several initiatives to support startups, such as the Startup India program, which provides funding, mentorship, and other support to startups.\\n\\nmentorship, and other support to startups.\\n\\nRelated Post :\\n\\nReasons Why India Has Become a Global Leader in the Digital Revolution\\n\\nHuge Pool of Talent: India is home to a vast pool of talented engineers, developers, and IT professionals. The country produces over 1.5 million engineering graduates every year, and a significant percentage of them have IT-related skills. The talent pool in India is one of the primary reasons why the country has become a global leader in the digital revolution. The availability of skilled workers has enabled Indian companies to develop cutting-edge technologies and compete on a global scale.\\n\\nCost-Effective Solutions: One of the significant advantages of the Indian IT industry is its cost-effectiveness. The cost of labor in India is much lower than in developed countries like the US and the UK. This has made it possible for Indian companies to offer cost-effective solutions to their clients. Many global companies outsource their IT work to India, which has helped to fuel the growth of the Indian IT industry. The cost-effectiveness of Indian IT companies has also enabled them to compete with global players and win contracts.\\n\\nRecent Posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Global Council for the Promotion of International Trade is proud to announce the upcoming Leadership RoundTable Interaction on Sustaining & Nurturing a Value-driven Organization.

natural resource on Earth. It sustains all life. There is no life without water. Water is not only important for human beings but for the entire ecosystem. Without enough water, the existence of humans, as well as animals, is next to impossible. After fresh air, water is the second most important natural resource for the survival of any living being.Water is necessary for the survival of each living creature on this planet, be it a small worm, plant, or full-grown tree. Animals and plants cannot survive without water. About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered with water. Unfortunately, only 3% of the water available is freshwater. About two-thirds of the freshwater lies in the form of frozen glaciers and ice caps. The rest of the small portion is available in the form of groundwater and surface water. Depletion of fresh water has become a threat to our existence. According to some scientists, the quantity and the quality of water are degrading day by day. Although Earth is covered with almost 71% of water, the quality is that we cannot use it in day-to-day life for domestic purposes.Due to the increasing environmental pollution, the drops of water, which transmit life force to all the living beings, flora and fauna of the earth, is becoming contaminated. Therefore, the crisis of clean drinking water is the biggest crisis for the existence of human beings on this earth. The only solution to this problem is to bring awareness which requires immediate attention of individuals, institutions and government.Man may reach the heights of material progress and scientific achievements, but his life is incomplete without water. It is necessary for all of us to understand that it is only through water conservation and water management, we can overcome this crisis which is threatening our existence. It is being observed that size of rivers and traditional water sources are reducing day by day and this can lead to water scarcity in the near future times. Water is nectarFor thousands of years, man searched for the nectar as described in mythological texts. But he didn’t understand that water obtained from pure and natural sources is that nectar which provides him with life force and good health. Water is life and he is living in a world of modernity and materialism where he has forgotten the importance of water. He is thus, facing health related diseases and environmental disaster.Man is destroying the natural and traditional sources of water due to his greediness. Due to indiscriminate urbanization and industrialization, pollution   of underground water and rivers is continuously increasing as all toxic chemical substances (industrial wastes) are secreted into the river. This is giving rise to shortage of clean drinking water. Drinking water obtained through scientific techniques and methods can never be a substitute for pure and naturally obtained drinking water. If there is water, there is futureThe golden future of man does not depend on the human settlements being built on the moon, but on pure natural drinking water. Pure drinking water is the golden future of humanity. Nature responds to our vibrations and natural resources were pure and pristine during the Golden Age. Satyuga (Golden age) is the world where clean and pure water is available through natural sources. It has been proved by the modern scientific researchers that the positive waves (vibes) generated by human thoughts makes water pure, satwic and energetic.Man can attain economic prosperity and attainment only by conserving water. So, water conservation is our primary and essential need. Clean air can be obtained only from clean water. Water is speaking to man in silent language, ‘You conserve me, I will give you life.’ Need for water conservationWater conservation is essential for making the earth green by reducing deserts, expanding the continuously shrinking water streams of rivers, raising the underground water level and for the well-being, progress and prosperity of human beings.In order to conserve rain water, motivate people to make ‘Rain Water Harvesting System’ in their house-courtyard, fields, open fields, etc. This step is the urgent need and call of the time. The underground water level can be raised by stopping the wasted water by making small dams. Ground water can be used as per minimum requirement. This is also a meaningful step towards water conservation.Creating awareness of water conservationRajyoga and spirituality plays a vital role in creating special awareness among the people for water conservation. Creating awareness of pure and clean water among the people gives way for water conservation. People can be easily made aware of water conservation by instilling respect for elements of nature. Awareness of water conservation is very important for the existence of human life.  Purification of Nature by Rajyoga MeditationRajyoga meditation is a very effective technique for the development of inner consciousness and awareness towards human values and nature. The practice of Rajyoga develops satwic instincts and attitudes in man, due to which the ongoing struggle between man and nature ends. It also leads to overall harmony. In fact, there is a very deep connection between nature and spirituality.It has been proved through scientific research that the Powerful and positive thought waves that are generated by the practice of Rajyoga have a deep impact in the environment and nature. This also increases the productivity of plants and crops. It completely ends the dependence on toxic chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Due to this, both water and land are directly conserved and promoted.Contribution of Brahma Kumaris organization in water conservationEco-friendly systems have been built for water conservation in international headquarters of Brahma Kumaris including Gyan Sarovar, Shantivan and other areas. In order to maintain the underground water level in the Shantivan campus, arrangements have been made to store 32 lakh litres of water and 8 lakh litres of water is purified by chain filter method and the used water is made clean again by recycling method and this water is used for watering plants. The campus is made green by irrigation.The Brahma Kumaris Organization regularly participates in UN conferences, seminars and campaigns on conservation of water and nature around the world. Here the youths are taught about conservation of water and nature. They are given various online training too. The Rural Development Wing of Rajyoga Education & Research Foundation, sister concern of Brahma Kumaris is playing an active role in this direction.Jal Jan AbhiyanJal Jan Abhiyan is being implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti and the Brahma Kumaris organization. It is a positive initiative taken in the direction of water conservation to save human beings and humanity. The goal of water conservation can be achieved only by creating collective consciousness among the people by conserving water and nature. This campaign has been planned keeping in mind its objectives.Objectives of Jal -Jan Abhiyan:1) Creating awareness among the people about water conservation through water management. 2) Motivating people to conserve water by ‘Rain Water Harvesting System’, in the land available with them.3) Encouraging traditional sources of water conservation such as digging ponds and drains or building small water storages on sloping land.4) Motivating people to plant trees on vacant lands and fields.5) Motivating farmers to save water by irrigating with sprinkler method.6) To generate positive consciousness among people towards water conservation through Rajyoga Meditation.7) Seminars can be conducted to create awareness about water conservation.8) Organizing Essay & debate competition for school or college students so that awareness can be created for water conservation.9) Various fairs and exhibitions can be organized for farmers and villagers to create awareness for water conservation.10) Religious and social organizations can play an important role in creating awareness among youth and women about water conservation.11) To make people aware about water conservation through printing press, electronic and social media.12) To bring awareness in every house towards water conservation.
